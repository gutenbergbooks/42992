oil-mill). Followers of this calling are known also as
Vattakk&#257;dans in South Malabar, and as V&#257;niyans in North
Malabar, but the former are the higher in social status, the
N&#257;yars being polluted by the touch of the V&#257;niyans and
Chakk&#257;ns, but not by that of the Vattakk&#257;dans. Chakk&#257;ns
and V&#257;niyans may not enter Br&#257;hman temples. Their customs and
manners are similar to those of the N&#257;yars, who will not, however,

a synonym for Chakk&#257;n.</p>
<p><b>Chakkiliyan.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The Chakkiliyans,&rdquo; Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e453src" href="#xd21e453"
name="xd21e453src">2</a> &ldquo;are the leather-workers of the Tamil
districts, corresponding to the M&#257;digas of the Telugu country. The
Chakkiliyans appear to be immigrants from the Telugu or Canarese
districts, for no mention is made of this caste either in the early
Tamil inscriptions, or in early Tamil literature. Moreover, a very
large proportion of the Chakkiliyans speak Telugu and Canarese. In
social position the Chakkiliyans occupy the lowest rank, though there
is much dispute on this point between them and the Paraiyans. Nominally
they are Saivites, but in reality devil-worshippers. The &#257;varam
plant (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>) is held in much veneration by
them,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e459src" href="#xd21e459" name=
"xd21e459src">3</a> and the t&#257;li is tied to a branch of it as a
preliminary to marriage. Girls are not usually married before puberty.
The bridegroom may be younger than the bride. Their widows may remarry.
Divorce can be obtained at the pleasure of either party on payment of
Rs. 12&ndash;12&ndash;0 to the other in the presence of the local head
of the caste. Their women are considered to be very beautiful, and it
is a woman of this caste who is generally selected for the coarser form
of Sakti worship. They indulge very freely in intoxicating liquors, and
will eat any flesh, including beef, pork, etc. Hence they are called,
<i>par excellence</i>, the flesh-eaters (Sanskrit shatkuli).&rdquo; It
was noted by Sonnerat, in the eighteenth century,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e465src" href="#xd21e465" name="xd21e465src">4</a> that the
Chakkiliyans are in more contempt than the Pariahs, because
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>they use cow leather in making shoes. &ldquo;The
Chucklers or cobblers,&rdquo; the Abb&eacute; Dubois writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e471src" href="#xd21e471" name="xd21e471src">5</a>
&ldquo;are considered inferiors to the Pariahs all over the peninsula.
They are more addicted to drunkenness and debauchery. Their orgies take
place principally in the evening, and their villages resound, far into
the night, with the yells and quarrels which result from their
intoxication. The very Pariahs refuse to have anything to do with the
Chucklers, and do not admit them to any of their feasts.&rdquo; In the
Madura Manual, 1868, the Chakkiliyans are summed up as &ldquo;dressers
of leather, and makers of slippers, harness, and other leather
articles. They are men of drunken and filthy habits, and their morals
are very bad. Curiously enough, their women are held to be of the
Padmani kind, <i>i.e.</i>, of peculiar beauty of face and form, and are
also said to be very virtuous. It is well known, however, that
zamindars and other rich men are very fond of intriguing with them,
particularly in the neighbourhood of Paramagudi, where they live in
great numbers.&rdquo; There is a Tamil proverb that even a Chakkili
girl and the ears of the millet are beautiful when mature. In the
Tanjore district, the <span class="corr" id="xd21e477" title=
"Source: Chakkiliyars">Chakkiliyans</span> are said<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e480src" href="#xd21e480" name="xd21e480src">6</a> to be
&ldquo;considered to be of the very lowest status. In some parts of the
district they speak Telugu and wear the n&#257;mam (Vaishnavite sect
mark) and are apparently immigrants from the Telugu country.&rdquo;
Though they are Tamil-speaking people, the Chakkiliyans, like the
Telugu M&#257;digas, have exogamous septs called g&#333;tra in the
north, and k&#299;lai in the south. Unlike the M&#257;digas, they do
not carry out the practice of making Basavis (dedicated prostitutes).

<p>The correlation of the most important measurements of the
M&#257;digas of the Telugu country, and so-called Chakkiliyans of the
city of Madras, is clearly brought out by the following

<p>The Chakkiliyan men in Madras are tattooed not only on the forehead,
but also with their name, conventional devices, dancing-girls, etc., on
the chest and upper extremities.</p>
<p>It has been noticed as a curious fact that, in the Madura district,
&ldquo;while the men belong to the right-hand faction, the women belong
to and are most energetic supporters of the left. It is even said that,
during the entire period of a faction riot, the Chakkili women keep
aloof from their husbands and deny them their marital
rights.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e561src" href="#xd21e561"
name="xd21e561src">7</a></p>
<p>In a very interesting note on the leather industry of the Madras
Presidency, Mr. A. Chatterton writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e566src" href="#xd21e566" name="xd21e566src">8</a> &ldquo;The
position of the Chakkiliyan in the south differs greatly from that of
the M&#257;diga of the north, and many of his privileges are enjoyed by
a &lsquo;sub-sect&rsquo; of the Pariahs called Vettiyans. These people
possess the right of removing dead cattle from villages, and in return
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>have to supply leather for agricultural purposes.
The majority of Chakkiliyans are not tanners, but leather-workers, and,
instead of getting the hides or skins direct from the Vettiyan, they
prefer to purchase them ready-tanned from traders, who bring them from
the large tanning centres. When the Chuckler starts making shoes or
sandals, he purchases the leather and skin which he requires in the
bazar, and, taking it home, first proceeds with a preliminary currying
operation. The leather is damped and well stretched, and dyed with
aniline, the usual colour being scarlet R.R. of the Badische Anilin
Soda Fabrik. This is purchased in the bazar in packets, and is
dissolved in water, to which a little oxalic acid has been added. The
dye is applied with a piece of rag on the grain side, and allowed to
dry. After drying, tamarind paste is applied to the flesh side of the
skin, and the latter is then rolled between the hands, so as to produce
a coarse graining on the outer side. In making the shoes, the leather
is usually wetted, and moulded into shape on wooden moulds or lasts. As
a rule, nothing but cotton is used for sewing, and the waxed ends of
the English <span class="corr" id="xd21e571" title=
"Source: cobler">cobbler</span> are entirely unknown. The largest
consumption of leather in this Presidency is for water-bags or
kavalais, which are used for raising water from wells, and for oil and
ghee (clarified butter) pots, in which the liquids are transported from
one place to another. Of irrigation wells there are in the Presidency
more than 600,000, and, though some of them are fitted with iron
buckets, nearly all of them have leather bags with leather discharging
trunks. The buckets hold from ten to fifty gallons of water, and are
generally made from fairly well tanned cow hides, though for very large
buckets buffalo hides are sometimes used. The number of oil and ghee
pots in use in the country is very large. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>The use of leather vessels
for this purpose is on the decline, as it is found much cheaper and
more convenient to store oil in the ubiquitous kerosine-oil tin, and it
is not improbable that eventually the industry will die out, as it has
done in other countries. The range of work of the country Chuckler is
not very extensive. Besides leather straps for wooden sandals, he makes
crude harness for the ryot&rsquo;s cattle, including leather collars
from which numerous bells are frequently suspended, leather whips for
the cattle drivers, ornamental fringes for the bull&rsquo;s forehead,
bellows for the smith, and small boxes for the barber, in which to
carry his razors. In some places, leather ropes are used for various
purposes, and it is customary to attach big coir (cocoanut fibre) ropes
to the bodies of the larger temple cars by leather harness, when they
are drawn in procession through the streets. Drum-heads and tom-toms
are made from raw hides by Vettiyans and Chucklers. The drums are often
very large, and are transported upon the back of elephants, horses,
bulls and camels. For them raw hides are required, but for the smaller
instruments sheep-skins are sufficient. The raw hides are shaved on the
flesh side, and are then dried. The hair is removed by rubbing with
wood-ashes. The use of lime in unhairing is not permissible, as it
materially decreases the elasticity of the parchment.&rdquo; The
Chakkiliyans beat the tom-tom for Kamm&#257;lans, Pallis and
Kaik&#333;lans, and for other castes if desired to do so.</p>
<p>The Chakkiliyans do not worship M&#257;tangi, who is the special
deity of the M&#257;digas. Their gods include Madurai V&#299;ran,
M&#257;riamma, M&#363;neswara, Draupadi and Gangamma. Of these, the
last is the most important, and her festival is celebrated annually, if
possible. To cover the expenses thereof, a few Chakkiliyans dress up
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>so as to represent men and women of the Mar&#257;thi
bird-catching caste, and go about begging in the streets for nine days.
On the tenth day the festival terminates. Throughout it, Gangamma,
represented by three decorated pots under a small pandal (booth) set up
on the bank of a river or tank beneath a margosa (<i>Melia
azadirachta</i>), or p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) tree, is
worshipped. On the last day, goats and fowls are sacrificed, and limes
cut.</p>
<p>During the first menstrual period, the Chakkiliyan girl is kept
under pollution in a hut made of fresh green boughs, which is erected
by her husband or maternal uncle. Meat, curds, and milk are forbidden.
On the last day, the hut is burnt down. At marriages a Chakkiliyan
usually officiates as priest, or the services of a Valluvan priest may
be enlisted. The consent of the girl&rsquo;s maternal uncle to the
marriage is essential. The marriage ceremony closely resembles that of
the Paraiyans. And, at the final death ceremonies of a Chakkiliyan, as
of a Paraiyan, two bricks are worshipped, and thrown into a tank or
stream.</p>
<p>Lean children, especially of the M&#257;la, M&#257;diga, and
Chakkiliyan classes, are made to wear a leather strap, specially made
for them by a Chakkiliyan, which is believed to help their growth.</p>
<p>At times of census, some Chakkiliyans have returned themselves as
Pagadaiyar, Mad&#257;ri (conceit or arrogance), and Ranav&#299;ran
(brave warrior).</p>
<p><b>Ch&#257;kkiyar.</b>&mdash;The Ch&#257;kkiyars are a class of
Ambalav&#257;sis, of whom the following account is given in the
Travancore Census Report, 1901. The name is generally derived from
Slaghyav&#257;kkuk&#257;r (those with eloquent words), and refers to
the traditional function of the caste in Malabar society. According to
the J&#257;tinirnaya, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>Ch&#257;kkiyars represent a caste growth
of the Kaliyuga. The offence to which the first Ch&#257;kkiyar owes his
position in society was, it would appear, brought to light after the
due performance of the upanayanasamsk&#257;ra. Persons, in respect of
whom the lapse was detected before that spiritualizing ceremony took
place, became Nambiyars. Manu derives S&#363;ta, whose functions are
identical with the Malabar Ch&#257;kkiyar, from a pratil&#333;ma union,
<i>i.e.</i>, of a Br&#257;hman wife with a Kshatriya husband.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e602src" href="#xd21e602" name="xd21e602src">9</a>
The girls either marry into their own caste, or enter into the
sambandham form of alliance with Namb&#363;tiris. They are called
Ill&#333;ttammamar. Their jewelry resembles that of the
Namb&#363;tiris. The Ch&#257;kkiyar may choose a wife for sambandham
from among the Nambiyars. They are their own priests, but the
Br&#257;hmans do the purification (puny&#257;ham) of house and person
after birth or death pollution. The pollution itself lasts for eleven
days. The number of times the G&#257;yatri (hymn) may be repeated is
ten.</p>
<p>The traditional occupation of the Ch&#257;kkiyans is the recitation
of Pur&#257;nic stories. The accounts of the Avat&#257;ras have been
considered the highest form of scripture of the non-Br&#257;hmanical
classes, and the early Br&#257;hmans utilised the intervals of their
V&#275;dic rites, <i>i.e.</i>, the afternoons, for listening to their
recitation by castes who could afford the leisure to study and narrate
them. Special adaptations for this purpose have been composed by
writers like Narayana Bhattap&#257;da, generally known as the
Bhattatiripp&#257;t, among whose works D&#363;tav&#257;kya,
P&#257;nch&#257;lisvayamvara, Subhadr&#257;hana and
Kaunt&#275;y&#257;shtaka are the most popular. In addition to these,
standard works like Bh&#333;gachampu and M&#257;han&#257;taka are often
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>pressed into the Ch&#257;kkiyar&rsquo;s service.
Numerous upakath&#257;s or episodes are brought in by way of
illustration, and the marvellous flow of words, and the telling humour
of the utterances, keep the audience spell-bound. On the utsavam
programme of every important temple, especially in North Travancore,
the Ch&#257;kkiyark&#363;ttu (Ch&#257;kkiyar&rsquo;s performance) is an
essential item. A special building, known as k&#363;ttampalam, is
intended for this purpose. Here the Ch&#257;kkiyar instructs and
regales his hearers, antiquely dressed, and seated on a three-legged
stool. He wears a peculiar turban with golden rim and silk embossments.
A long piece of cloth with coloured edges, wrapped round the loins in
innumerable vertical folds with an elaborateness of detail difficult to
describe, is the Ch&#257;kkiyar&rsquo;s distinctive apparel. Behind him
stands the Nambiyar, whose traditional kinship with the Ch&#257;kkiyar
has been referred to, with a big jar-shaped metal drum in front of him
called mil&#257;vu, whose bass sound resembles the echo of distant
thunder. The Nambiyar is indispensable for the
Ch&#257;kkiyark&#363;ttu, and sounds his mighty instrument at the
beginning, at the end, and also during the course of his recitation,
when the Ch&#257;kkiyar arrives at the middle and end of a Sanskrit
verse. The Nangayar, a female of the Nambiyar caste, is another
indispensable element, and sits in front of the Ch&#257;kkiyar with a
cymbal in hand, which she sounds occasionally. It is interesting to
note that, amidst all the boisterous merriment into which the audience
may be thrown, there is one person who has to sit motionless like a
statue. If the Nangayar is moved to a smile, the k&#363;ttu must stop,
and there are cases where, in certain temples, the k&#363;ttu has thus
become a thing of the past. The Ch&#257;kkiyar often makes a feint of
representing some of his audience as his characters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>for the
scene under depictment. But he does it in such a genteel way that
rarely is offence taken. It is an unwritten canon of
Ch&#257;kkiyark&#363;ttu that the performance should stop at once if
any of the audience so treated should speak out in answer to the
Ch&#257;kkiyar, who, it may be added, would stare at an admiring
listener, and thrust questions on him with such directness and force as
to need an extraordinary effort to resist a reply. And so realistic is
his performance that a tragic instance is said to have occurred when,
by a cruel irony of fate, his superb skill cost a Ch&#257;kkiyar his
life. While he was explaining a portion of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata
with inimitable theatrical effect, a desperate friend of the
P&#257;ndavas rose from his seat in a fit of uncontrollable passion,
and actually knocked the Ch&#257;kkiyar dead when, in an attitude of
unmistakable though assumed heartlessness, he, as personating
Dury&#333;dhana, inhumanely refused to allow even a pin-point of ground
to his exiled cousins. This, it is believed, occurred in a private
house, and thereafter k&#363;ttu was prohibited except at temples.</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that
&ldquo;Ch&#257;kkiyars or Sl&#257;ghyar-vakukar are a caste following
makkatt&#257;yam (inheritance from father to son), and wear the
p&#363;n&#363;l (thread). They are recruited from girls born to a
Namb&#363;diri woman found guilty of adultery, after the date at which
such adultery is found to have commenced, and boys of similar origin,
who have been already invested with the sacred thread. Boys who have
not been invested with the p&#363;n&#363;l when their mother is
declared an adulteress, join the class known as Ch&#257;kkiyar
Nambiyars, who follow marumakkatt&#257;yam (inheritance in the female
line), and do not wear the thread. The girls join either caste
indifferently. Ch&#257;kkiyars may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>marry Nangiyars, but
Ch&#257;kkiyar Nambiyars may not marry Ill&#333;tammamar.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ch&#257;liyan.</b>&mdash;The Ch&#257;liyans are a caste of
Malay&#257;lam cotton weavers, concerning whom Mr. Francis writes as
follows<a class="noteref" id="xd21e622src" href="#xd21e622" name=
"xd21e622src">10</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;In dress and manners they resemble
the artisan castes of Malabar, but, like the Pattar Br&#257;hmans, they
live in streets, which fact probably points to their being
comparatively recent settlers from the east coast. They have their own
barbers called Potuv&#257;ns, who are also their pur&#333;hits. They do
not wear the sacred thread, as the S&#257;l&#275; weavers of the east
coast do. They practise ancestor worship, but without the assistance of
Br&#257;hman priests. This is the only Malabar caste which has anything
to do with the right and left-hand faction disputes, and both divisions
are represented in it, the left hand being considered the superior.
Apparently, therefore, it settled in Malabar some time after the
beginnings of this dispute on the east coast, that is, after the
eleventh century A. D. Some of them follow the marumakkat&#257;yam and
others the makkat&#257;yam law of inheritance, which looks as if the
former were earlier settlers than the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ch&#257;liyans are so called because, unlike most of the west
coast classes, they live in streets, and Teruvan (teru, a street)
occurs as a synonym for the caste name. The right-hand section are said
to worship the elephant god Gan&#275;sa, and the left
Bhagav&#257;ti.</p>
<p>The following account of the Ch&#257;liyans is given in the
Gazetteer of the Malabar district: &ldquo;Ch&#257;liyans are almost
certainly a class of immigrants from the east coast. They live in
regular streets, a circumstance strongly supporting this view. The
traditional account <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>is to the same effect. It is said that they
were originally of a high caste, and were imported by one of the
Z&#257;morins, who wished to introduce the worship of Ganapathi, to
which they are much addicted. The latter&rsquo;s minister, the Mangatt
Acchan, who was entrusted with the entertainment of the new arrivals,
and was nettled by their fastidiousness and constant complaints about
his catering, managed to degrade them in a body by the trick of
secretly mixing fish with their food. They do not, like their
counterparts on the east coast, wear the thread; but it is noticeable
that their priests, who belong to their own caste, wear it over the
right shoulder instead of over the left like the Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s
p&#363;n&#363;l, when performing certain p&#363;jas (worship). In some
parts, the place of the regular p&#363;n&#363;l is taken by a red scarf
or sash worn in the same manner. They are remarkable for being the only
caste in Malabar amongst whom any trace of the familiar east coast
division into right-hand and left-hand factions is to be found. They
are so divided; and those belonging to the right-hand faction deem
themselves polluted by the touch of those belonging to the left-hand
sect, which is numerically very weak. They are much addicted to
devil-dancing, which rite is performed by certain of their numbers
called K&#333;marams in honour of Bhagavathi and the minor deities
Vettekkorumagan and Gulikan (a demon). They appear to follow
makkat&#257;yam (descent from father to son) in some places, and
marumakkat&#257;yam (inheritance in the female line) in others. Their
pollution period is ten days, and their purification is performed by
the Talikunnavan (sprinkler), who belongs to a somewhat degraded
section of the caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The affairs of the caste are managed by headmen called Ur&#257;lans,
and the caste barber, or Pothuvan, acts as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>the
caste messenger. Council meetings are held at the village temple, and
the fines inflicted on guilty persons are spent in celebrating
p&#363;ja (worship) thereat.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, the elderly females of Ur&#257;lan
families take her to a tank, and pour water over her head from small
cups made of the leaves of the j&#257;k (<i>Artocarpus
integrifolia</i>) tree. She is made to sit apart on a mat in a room
decorated with young cocoanut leaves. Round the mat raw rice and paddy
(unhusked rice) are spread, and a vessel containing cocoanut flowers
and cocoanuts is placed near her. On the third evening, the washerman
(Peruvann&#257;n) brings some newly-washed cloths (m&#257;ttu). He is
presented with some rice and paddy, which he ties up in a leaf, and
does p&#363;ja. He then places the cloths on a plank, which he puts on
his head. After repeating some songs or verses, he sets it down on the
floor. Some of the girl&rsquo;s female relations take a lighted lamp, a
pot of water, a measure of rice, and go three times round the plank. On
the following day, the girl is bathed, and the various articles which
have been kept in her room are thrown into a river or tank.</p>
<p>Like many other Malabar castes, the Ch&#257;liyans perform the
t&#257;li kettu ceremony. Once in several years, the girls of the
village who have to go through this ceremony are brought to the house
of one of the Ur&#257;lans, where a pandal (booth) has been set up.
Therein a plank, made of the wood of the p&#257;la tree (<i>Alstonia
scholaris</i>), a lighted lamp, betel leaves and nuts, a measure of raw
rice, etc., are placed. The girl takes her seat on the plank, holding
in her right hand a mimic arrow (shanthulk&#333;l). The Pothuvan, who
receives a fanam (coin) and three bundles of betel leaves for his
services, hands the t&#257;li to a male member of an Ur&#257;lan
family, who ties it on the girl&rsquo;s neck. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the day before the wedding-day the bridegroom, accompanied by his
male relations, proceeds to the house of the bride, where a feast is
held. On the following day the bride is bathed, and made to stand
before a lighted lamp placed on the floor. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
father or uncle places two gold fanams (coins) in her hands, and a
further feast takes place.</p>
<p>In the seventh month of pregnancy, the ceremony called puli kudi (or
drinking tamarind) is performed. The woman&rsquo;s brother brings a
twig of a tamarind tree, and, after the leaves have been removed,
plants it in the yard of the house. The juice is extracted from the
leaves, and mixed with the juice of seven cocoanuts. The elderly female
relations of the woman give her a little of the mixture. The ceremony
is repeated during three days. Birth pollution is removed by a barber
woman sprinkling water on the ninth day.</p>
<p>The dead are buried. The son carries a pot of water to the grave,
round which he takes it three times. The barber makes a hole in the
pot, which is then thrown down at the head of the grave. The barber
also tears off a piece of the cloth, in which the corpse is wrapped.
This is, on the tenth day, taken by the son and barber to the sea or a
tank, and thrown into it. Three stones are set up over the grave.</p>
<p>Ch&#257;liyan also occurs as an occupational title or sub-division
of N&#257;yars, and Ch&#257;liannaya as an exogamous sept of Bant. In
the Madras Census Report, 1901, Ch&#257;liyan is given as a sub-caste
of V&#257;niyan (oil-pressers). Some Ch&#257;liyans are, however,
oilmongers by profession.</p>
<p><b>Challa.</b>&mdash;Challa, meaning apparently eaters of refuse,
occurs as a sub-division of Y&#257;n&#257;dis, and meaning buttermilk
as an exogamous sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga. Challak&#363;ti,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>meaning those who eat old or cold food, is an
exogamous sept of K&#257;pus.</p>
<p><b>Chamar.</b>&mdash;Nearly three hundred members of this Bengal
caste of tanners and workers in leather were returned at the census,
1901. The equivalent Chamura occurs as the name of leather-workers from
the Central Provinces.</p>
<p><b>Chand&#257;la.</b>&mdash;At the census, 1901, more than a
thousand individuals returned themselves as Chand&#257;la, which is
defined as a generic term, meaning one who pollutes, to many low
castes. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Surgeon-Major W. R. Cornish
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e669src" href="#xd21e669" name=
"xd21e669src">11</a> &ldquo;characteristic of the Br&#257;hmanical
intolerance of the compilers of the code that the origin of the lowest
caste of all (the Chand&#257;la) should be ascribed to the intercourse
of a S&#363;dra man and a Br&#257;hman woman, while the union of a
Br&#257;hman male with a S&#363;dra woman is said to have resulted in
one of the highest of the mixed classes.&rdquo; By Manu it was laid
down that &ldquo;the abode of the Chand&#257;la and Swapaca must be out
of the town. They must not have the use of entire vessels. Their sole
wealth must be dogs and asses. Their clothes must be the mantles of the
deceased; their dishes for food broken pots; their ornaments rusty
iron; continually must they roam from place to place. Let no man who
regards his duty, religious and civil, hold any intercourse with them,
and let food be given to them in potsherds, but not by the hand of the
giver.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandra</b> (moon).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba. The name
Chandravamsapu (moon people) is taken by some R&#257;zus, who claim to
be Kshatriyas, and to be descended from the lunar race of kings of the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"

<p><b>Chapparam</b> (a pandal or booth).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Chapparband.</b>&mdash;The Chapparbands are manufacturers of
spurious coin, who hail from the Bombay Presidency, and are watched for
by the police. It is noted, in the Police Report, 1904, that good work
was done in Ganjam in tracing certain gangs of these coiners, and
bringing them to conviction.</p>
<p>For the following note I am indebted to a report<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e700src" href="#xd21e700" name="xd21e700src">12</a> by Mr. H.
N. Alexander of the Bombay Police Department. The name Chapparband
refers to their calling, chapa meaning an impression or stamp.
&ldquo;Among themselves they are known as Bhadoos, but in Hindustan,
and among Thugs and cheats generally, they are known as Khoolsurrya,
<i>i.e.</i>, false coiners. While in their villages, they cultivate the
fields, rear poultry and breed sheep, while the women make quilts,
which the men sell while on their tours. But the real business of this
class is to make and pass off false coin. Laying aside their ordinary
Muhammadan dress, they assume the dress and appearance of fakirs of the
Muddar section, Muddar being their Pir, and, unaccompanied by their
women, wander from village to village. Marathi is their language, and,
in addition, they have a peculiar slang of their own. Like all people
of this class, they are superstitious, and will not proceed on an
expedition unless a favourable omen is obtained. The following account
is given, showing how the false coin is manufactured. A <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>mould
serves only once, a new one being required for every rupee or other
coin. It is made of unslaked lime and a kind of yellow earth called
shedoo, finely powdered and sifted, and patiently kneaded with water to
about the consistency of putty. One of the coins to be imitated is then
pressed with some of the preparation, and covered over, and, being cut
all round, is placed in some embers. After becoming hardened, it is
carefully laid open with a knife, and, the coin being taken out, its
impression remains. The upper and lower pieces are then joined together
with a kind of gum, and, a small hole being made on one side, molten
tin is poured in, and thus an imitation of the coin is obtained, and it
only remains to rub it over with dirt to give it the appearance of old
money. The tin is purchased in any bazaar, and the false money is
prepared on the road as the gang travels along. Chapparbands adopt
several ways of getting rid of their false coin. They enter shops and
make purchases, showing true rupees in the first instance, and
substituting false ones at the time of payment. They change false
rupees for copper money, and also in exchange for good rupees of other
currencies. Naturally, they look out for women and simple people,
though the manner of passing off the base coin is clever, being done by
sleight of hand. The false money is kept in pockets formed within the
folds of their langutis (loin-cloths), and also hidden in the private
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following additional information concerning Chapparbands is
contained in the Illustrated Criminal Investigation and Law
Digest<a class="noteref" id="xd21e710src" href="#xd21e710" name=
"xd21e710src">13</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;They travel generally in small
gangs, and their women never follow them. They consult omens before
leaving their villages. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>do not leave their villages dressed
as fakirs. They generally visit some place far away from their
residence, and there disguise themselves as Madari fakirs, adding Shah
to their names. They also add the title Sahib, and imitate the Sawals,
a sing-song begging tone of their class. Their leader, Khagda, is
implicitly obeyed. He is the treasurer of the gangs, and keeps with him
the instruments used in coining, and the necessary metal pieces. But
the leader rarely keeps the coins with him. The duty of passing the
false coins belongs to the Bhondars. A boy generally accompanies a
gang. He is called Handiwal. He acts as a handy chokra (youngster), and
also as a watch over the camp when the false coins are being prepared.
They generally camp on high ground in close vicinity to water, which
serves to receive the false coins and implements, should danger be
apprehended. When moving from one camp to another, the Khagda and his
chokra travel alone, the former generally riding a small pony. The rest
of the gang keep busy passing the coins in the neighbourhood, and
eventually join the pair in the place pre-arranged. If the place be
found inconvenient for their purpose, another is selected by the
Khagda, but sufficient indication is given to the rest that the
rendezvous might be found out. This is done by making a mark on the
chief pathway leading to the place settled first, at a spot where
another pathway leads from it in the direction he is going. The mark
consists of a mud heap on the side of the road, a foot in length, six
inches in breadth, and six in height, with an arrow mark pointing in
the direction taken. The Khagda generally makes three of these marks at
intervals of a hundred yards, to avoid the chance of any being effaced.
Moulds are made of Mult&#257;ni or some sticky clay. Gopichandan and
badap <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>are also used. The clay, after being powdered and
sifted, is mixed with a little water and oil, and well kneaded. The two
halves of the mould are then roughly shaped with the hand, and a
genuine coin is pressed between them, so as to obtain the obverse on
one half and the reverse impression on the other. The whole is then
hardened in an extempore oven, and the hole to admit the metal is
bored, so as to admit of its being poured in from the edge. The halves
are then separated, and the genuine rupee is tilted out; the molten
alloy of tin or pewter is poured in, and allowed to cool. According to
the other method, badap clay brought from their own country is
considered the most suitable for the moulds, though Mult&#257;ni clay
may be used when they run out of badap. Two discs are made from clay
kneaded with water. These discs are then highly polished on the inner
surface with the top of a jvari stalk called danthal. A rupee, slightly
oiled, is then placed between the discs, which are firmly pressed over
it. The whole is then thoroughly hardened in the fire. The alloy used
in these moulds differs from that used in the others, and consists of
an alloy of lead and copper. In both cases, the milling is done by the
hand with a knife or a piece of shell. The Chapperbands select their
victims carefully. They seem to be fairly clever judges of persons from
their physiognomy. They easily find out the duffer and the gull in both
sexes, and take care to avoid persons likely to prove too sharp for
them. They give preference to women over men. The commonest method is
for the Bhondar to show a quantity of copper collected by him in his
character of beggar, and ask for silver in its place. The dupe produces
a rupee, which he looks at. He then shakes his head sadly, and hands
back a counterfeit coin, saying that such coins are not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>current
in his country, and moves on to try the same trick elsewhere. Their
dexterity in changing the rupees is very great, the result of long
practice when a Handiwal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further information in connection with the Chapparbands has recently
been published by Mr. M. Paupa Rao Naidu, from whose account<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e721src" href="#xd21e721" name="xd21e721src">14</a>
the following extract is taken. &ldquo;Chapperbands, as their name
implies, are by profession builders of roofs, or, in a more general
term, builders of huts. They are Sheikh Muhammadans, and originally
belonged to the Punjab. During the Moghul invasion of the Carnatic, as
far back as 1687&ndash;88, a large number of them followed the great
Moghul army as builders of huts for the men. They appear to have
followed the Moghul army to Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, and Seringapatam
until the year 1714, when Bijapur passed into the hands of the Peshwas.
The Chapperbands then formed part of the Peshwa&rsquo;s army in the
same capacity, and remained as such till the advent of the British in
the year 1818, when it would appear a majority of them, finding their
peculiar profession not much in demand, returned to the north. A part
of those who remained behind passed into the Nizam&rsquo;s territory,
while a part settled down in the Province of Talikota. A legendary
tale, narrated before the Superintendent of Police, Raipur, in 1904, by
an intelligent Chapperband, shows that they learnt this art of
manufacturing coins during the Moghul period. He said &lsquo;In the
time of the Moghul Empire, Chapperbands settled in the Bijapur
district. At that time, a fakir named Pir Bhai Pir Makhan lived in the
same district. One of the Chapperbands went to this fakir, and asked
him to intercede with God, in order that Chapperbands might be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>directed to take up some profession or other. The
fakir gave the man a rupee, and asked him to take it to his house
quickly, and not to look backwards as he proceeded on his way. As the
man ran home, some one called him, and he turned round to see who it
was. When he reached his house, he found the rupee had turned into a
false one. The man returned to the fakir, and complained that the rupee
was a false one. The fakir was much enraged at the man&rsquo;s account
of having looked back as he ran, but afterwards said that Chapperbands
would make a living in future by manufacturing false coins. Since that
time, Chapperbands have become coiners of false money.&rsquo; On every
Sunday, they collect all their false rupees, moulds, and other
implements, and, placing these in front of them, they worship Pir
Makhan, also called Pir Madar. They sacrifice a fowl to him, take out
its eyes and tail, and fix them on three thorns of the trees
b&#257;bul, bir, and thalmakana; and, after the worship is over, they
throw them in the direction in which they intend to start. The
Chapperbands conceal a large number of rupees in the rectum, long
misusage often forming a cavity capable of containing ten to twenty
rupees. So also cavities are formed in the mouth below the
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a case recorded by Mr. M. Kennedy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e731src" href="#xd21e731" name="xd21e731src">15</a> &ldquo;when a
Chapperband was arrested on suspicion, on his person being examined by
the Civil Surgeon, no less than seven rupees were found concealed in a
cavity in his rectum. The Civil Surgeon was of opinion that it must
have taken some considerable time to form such a cavity.&rdquo; A
similar case came before the Sessions Judge in South Canara a few years
ago. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following case of swindling, which occurred in the Tanjore
district, is recorded in the Police Report, 1903. &ldquo;A gang of
Muhammadans professed to be able to duplicate currency notes. The
method was to place a note with some blank sheets of paper between two
pieces of glass. The whole was then tied round with string and cloth,
and smoked over a fire. On opening the packet, two notes were found, a
second genuine one having been surreptitiously introduced. The success
of the first operations with small notes soon attracted clients, some
of them wealthy; and, when the bait had had time to work, and some very
large notes had been submitted for operation, the swindlers declared
that these large notes took longer to duplicate, and that the packet
must not be opened for several days. Before the time appointed for
opening, they disappeared, and the notes were naturally not found in
the packets. One gentleman was fleeced in this way to the value of Rs.
4,600.&rdquo; The administration of an enema to a false coiner will
sometimes bring to light hidden treasure.</p>
<p><b>Chapt&#275;g&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;The Chapt&#275;g&#257;ras or
Chept&#275;g&#257;ras are described by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e741src" href="#xd21e741" name="xd21e741src">16</a>
as &ldquo;carpenters who speak Konkani, and are believed to have come
from the Konkan country. Caste affairs are managed by a Gurikar or
headman, and the fines collected are paid to the Sring&#275;ri math.
They wear the sacred thread, and employ Kar&#257;di Br&#257;hmans as
pur&#333;hits. Infant marriage is practised, and widow marriage is not
permitted. The dead are burned if means allow; otherwise they are
buried. They are Saivites, and worship Durga and Ganapati. They eat
flesh and drink liquor. Their titles are Naik, Shenai, etc.&rdquo; It
is noted, in the Madras <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=

S&#257;raswat Br&#257;hmans will eat with them. Choutag&#257;ra has
been recorded as a corrupt form of Chapt&#275;g&#257;ra.</p>
<p><b>Charam&#363;rti.</b>&mdash;A class of Jangams, who go from

described<a class="noteref" id="xd21e755src" href="#xd21e755" name=
"xd21e755src">17</a> as &ldquo;Canarese carpenters corresponding to the
Konkani Chept&#275;g&#257;ras (or Chapt&#275;g&#257;ras), and there is
very little difference in the customs and manners of the two castes,
except that the former employ Shivalli and Konkanashta Br&#257;hmans
instead of Kar&#257;dis. Their title is Naika.&rdquo; In the Madras
Census Report, 1901, M&#275;sta is returned as a Konkani-speaking
sub-caste of Ch&#257;r&#333;di.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#257;tla</b> (winnow).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#257;diga.
Ch&#257;tla Dhompti occurs as a sub-division of M&#257;digas, who, at
marriages, place the offering of food, etc. (dhompti), in a winnow.</p>
<p><b>Chatri.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as
an equivalent of Kshatriya. It occurs also as the name of an exogamous
sept, meaning umbrella, of the Holeyas.</p>
<p><b>Chatur&#257;kshari.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of
S&#257;t&#257;nis, who believe in the efficacy of the four syllables
R&#257;-m&#257;-nu-ja.</p>
<p><b>Chaudari.</b>&mdash;Chaudari, or Chowdari, is recorded as a title
of Haddi, K&#257;lingi, and K&#333;mati.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=

<p><b>Chembadi.</b>&mdash;The Chembadis are a Telugu caste, the
occupations of which are fresh-water fishing, and rowing boats or
coracles. In fishing, unlike the Besthas who use a cast-net, they
employ a large drag-net, called baithivala, the two ends of which are
fastened to poles. When a new net is made, it is folded up, and placed
on the edge of a pond or tank. Mud is spread over it, and on it are
placed three masses of mud kneaded into a conical shape. These
represent the God, and cakes, called kudumulu, are set before them. A
male member of the caste, biting one of the cakes and keeping it
between his teeth, goes round the net, and then drags it to the water,
in which the conical masses become disintegrated. Like the Besthas,
they smear a new net with the blood of the first fish caught in it, but
they do not burn a mesh of the net.</p>
<p>Some Chembadis regard Gurappa Gurunathadu as their caste deity, and
connect him, for some unknown reason, with the jammi tree (<i>Prosopis
spicigera</i>). Jammi occurs as the name of a g&#333;tra, and some
children are named Gurappa or Gurunathadu. When such children are five,
seven, or nine years old, they are taken on an auspicious day to a
jammi tree and shaved, after the tree has been worshipped with
offerings of cooked food, etc.</p>
<p>At the betrothal ceremony in this caste, immediately after the girl
has taken up areca nuts, placed them in her lap, and folded them in her
cloth, the headman takes up the betel leaves and areca nuts
(thamb&#363;lam) before him with crossed hands. This ceremony
corresponds to the thonuku thamb&#363;lam of the lower classes,
<i>e.g.</i>, M&#257;las and Mangalas. Among the Mangalas and
Ts&#257;kalas, the thamb&#363;lam is said to be taken up by a Balija
Setti. For the funeral ceremonies, the Chembadis engage a D&#257;sari
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>of their own caste. During their performances,
flesh and toddy may not be offered to the deceased person.</p>
<p><b>Chembian.</b>&mdash;A name assumed by some Pallis or Vanniyans,
who claim that they belong to the Ch&#333;la race, on the supposition
that Chembin&#257;du is a synonym for Ch&#333;la.</p>
<p><b>Chembillam</b> (chembu, copper).&mdash;An exogamous section of
Mukkuvan.</p>
<p><b>Chemb&#333;tti.</b>&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1901, it
is stated that the name Chemb&#333;tti is derived from &ldquo;chembu,
copper, and kotti, he who beats.&rdquo; They are coppersmiths in
Malabar, who are distinct from the Malabar Kamm&#257;lans. They are
supposed to be descendants of men who made copper idols for temples,
and so rank above the Kamm&#257;lans in social position, and about
equally with the lower sections of the N&#257;yars. The name is also
used as an occupational term by the Konkan Native Christian
coppersmiths. In the Cochin and Travancore Census Reports, Chembukotti
is recorded as an occupational title or sub-caste of N&#257;yars who
work in copper, chiefly in temples and Br&#257;hman houses.</p>
<p>In the Gazetteer of the Malabar district, the Chemb&#333;ttis are
described as copper-workers, whose traditional business is the roofing
of the Sri-k&#333;vil, or inner shrine of the temple with that metal.
They are said to have originally formed part of the Kamm&#257;lan
community. &ldquo;When the great temple at Taliparamba was completed,
it was purified on a scale of unprecedented grandeur, no less than a
thousand Br&#257;hmans being employed. What was their dismay when the
ceremony was well forward, to see a Chemb&#333;tti coming from the
Sri-k&#333;vil, where he had been putting finishing touches to the
roof. This appeared to involve a recommencement of the whole

gave vent to their feelings of despair, when a vision from heaven
reassured them, and thereafter the Chemb&#333;ttis have been raised in
the social scale, and are not regarded as a polluting caste.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Chenchu.</b>&mdash;The Chenchus or Chentsus are a Telugu-speaking
jungle tribe inhabiting the hills of the Kurnool and Nellore districts.
In a letter addressed to the Bengal Asiatic Society,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e833src" href="#xd21e833" name="xd21e833src">18</a>
transmitting vocabularies of various tribes inhabiting Vizagapatam, by
Mr. Newill, it is stated that &ldquo;the Chenchu tribe, whose language
is almost entirely corrupt Hindi and Urdu with a few exceptions from
Beng&#257;li, affords one more example to the many forthcoming of an
uncultured aboriginal race having abandoned their own tongue.&rdquo;
The compiler of the Kurnool Manual (1885) remarks that Mr.
Newill&rsquo;s vocabulary &ldquo;seems to belong to the dialect spoken
by Lamb&#257;dis, who sometimes wander about the hills, and it is not
unlikely that he was misled as to the character of the persons from
whom his list was taken.&rdquo; As examples of the words given by Mr.
Newill, the following may be quoted:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Bone, had.</li>
<li>Cat, billeyi.</li>
<li>Ear, k&#257;n.</li>

</ul>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Newill confused the Chenchus with the
Bonthuk Savaras (<i>q.v.</i>) who speak corrupt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>Oriya,
and are called Chenchu v&#257;ndlu, and, like the Chenchus, believe
that the god Narasimha of Ah&#333;bilam married a girl belonging to
their tribe. As a further example of the confusion concerning the
Chenchus, I may quote the remarks of Buchanan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e865src" href="#xd21e865" name="xd21e865src">19</a> about the
Irulas, who are a Tamil-speaking jungle tribe: &ldquo;In this hilly
tract there is a race of men called by the other natives Cad Eriligaru,
but who call themselves Cat Chensu. The language of the Chensu is a
dialect of the Tamil, with occasionally a few Karnata or Telinga words
intermixed, but their accent is so different from that of Madras that
my servants did not at first understand what they said. Their original
country, they say, is the Animalaya forest below the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e868" title="Source: gh&aacute;ts">gh&#257;ts</span>, which is
confirmed by their dialect.&rdquo; In the Census Report, 1901, Chenchu
is said to be the name by which Irulas of North Arcot and the Mysore
plateau are called sometimes, and, in the Census Report, 1891, Chenchu
is given as a sub-division of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis. There can be
little doubt that the Chenchus and Y&#257;n&#257;dis are descended from
the same original stock. Mackenzie, in the local records collected by
him, speaks of the Chenchus as being called Y&#257;n&#257;di Chenchus.
The Chenchus themselves at the present day say that they and the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis are one and the same, and that the tribes
intermarry.</p>
<p>In Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ferishta,&rsquo; the Chenchus are described
as they appeared before Prince Muhammad Mas&uacute;m, a son of
Aurangzib, who passed through the Kurnool district in 1694, as
&ldquo;exceedingly black, with long hair, and on their heads wore caps
made of the leaves of trees. Each man had with him unbarbed arrows and
a bow for hunting. They molest no one, and live in caverns or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>under the shady branches of trees. The prince
presented some of them with gold and silver, but they did not seem to
put any value on either, being quite unconcerned at receiving it. Upon
the firing of a gun, they darted up the mountains with a surprising
swiftness uncommon to man. In Taylor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Catalogue
raisonn&eacute; of Oriental Manuscripts,&rsquo; the Chenchus are
described as people who &ldquo;live to the westward of Ah&#333;balam,
Srisailam, and other places, in the woods or wilds, and go about,
constantly carrying in their hands bows and arrows. They clothe
themselves with leaves, and live on the sago or rice of the bamboo.
They rob travellers, killing them if they oppose. This people afflict
every living creature (kill for food is supposed to be meant).&rdquo;
It is noted in the Kurnool Manual that in former times the Chenchu
headman used to &ldquo;dispose of murder cases, the murderer, on proof
of guilt, being put to death with the same weapons with which the
murder was committed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e875src" href=
"#xd21e875" name="xd21e875src">20</a> Captain Newbold, writing in 1846,
says that, passing through the jungle near Pacharla, he observed a
skull bleached by the sun dangling from the branch of a tamarind tree,
which he was informed was that of a murderer and hill-robber put to
death by the headman. In the time of the Nabobs, some of the Chenchu
murderers were caught and punished, but the practice seems to have
prevailed among them more or less till the introduction of the new
police in 1860, since which time all cases are said to be reported to
the nearest police officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Chenchu Tali&#257;ri (village watchman), who came to see me at
Nandyal, was wearing a badge with his name engraved on it in Telugu,
which had been presented to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>him by Government in recognition of
his shooting with a double-barrelled gun two Donga Oddes who had robbed
a village. Another aged Tali&#257;ri had a silver bangle bearing a
Telugu inscription, which had been given to him in acknowledgment of
his capturing a murderer who was wanted by the police, and came to his
hut. The casual visitor explained that he was on his way to Hyderabad,
but the Chenchu, noticing blood on his clothes, tied him to a post, and
gave information that he had secured him. The same man had also
received presents for reporting cases of illicit distillation under the
Abk&#257;ri Act.</p>

</div>
<p>In recent accounts of the Chenchus of the Nallamalai hills by a
forest officer, it is noted that pilgrims, on their way to the
Srisailam temple, &ldquo;are exploited at every turn, the Chentzu being
seen in his true colours at this period, and, being among the most
active agents in the exactions, but not being by any means the only
plunderer. In return for the protection, the Chentzu levies a toll per
head, and as much more as he can extort. We had to interfere with the
perquisites of one drugged specimen of this race, who drew a knife on a
peon (orderly), and had to be sent down under escort.... It is commonly
supposed that the Chentzus are a semi-wild, innocent, inoffensive hill
tribe, living on roots, honey, wild fruits, and game. If this was so,
we should have no difficulty in controlling them. They are actually a
semi-wild, lazy, drinking set of brigands. They levy blackmail from
every village along the foot of the hills, and, if any ryot
(cultivator) refuses to pay up, his crop silently disappears on some
moonless night. They levy blackmail from every pilgrim to the shrines
in the hills. They levy blackmail from the graziers in the hills. They
borrow money from K&#333;matis and Buniahs (merchants <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>and
money-lenders), and repay it in kind&mdash;stolen timber, minor forest
produce, etc. They are constantly in debt to the K&#333;matis, and are
practically their slaves as regards the supply of timber and other
forest produce. They think nothing of felling a tree in order to
collect its fruits, and they fire miles of forest in order to be able
to collect with ease certain minor produce, or to trace game. They
poison the streams throughout the hills, and in short do exactly as
they please throughout the length and breadth of the
Nallamalais.&rdquo; The Conservator of Forests expressed his belief
that this picture was not overdrawn, and added that the Chenchus are
&ldquo;a danger to the forest in many ways, and I have always thought
it a pity that they were given some of the rights at settlement, which
stand against their names. These rights were&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Rights of way, and to carry torches.</li>
<li>(2) Rights to draw and drink water from, wash or bathe in all
streams, springs, wells and pools.</li>
<li>(3) Rights to forest produce for home use.</li>
<li>(4) Rights to fish and shoot.</li>
<li>(5) Rights to graze a limited number of cattle, sheep and
goats.</li>
<li>(6) Rights to collect for sale or barter certain minor
produce.</li>
</ul>
<p>In connection with right (3), the District Forest Officer suggested
that &ldquo;the quantity to be taken annually must be limited,
especially in the case of wood, bamboos, fibre, firewood and honey. The
quality of the wood and of other forest produce should be defined.
Chenchus do not require teak or ebony beams or yegi (<i>Pterocarpus
Marsupium</i>) spokes and felloes for domestic purposes; but, as the
right now stands, they can fell whatever they like, and, though we may
know it is for sale to merchants, the Chenchus have only to say it is
for domestic use, and they cannot be punished. The wood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>should
be limited to poles and smaller pieces of third-class and unclassified
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1898 the Governor in Council made the following rules for
regulating the exercise of the rights of the Chenchus living in the
reserved forests on the Nallamalais:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The carrying of torches, and the lighting of fires in
fire-protected blocks during the fire season are prohibited.</p>
<p>2. There shall be no right to wash or bathe in such springs, wells,
pools or portions of streams as are especially set apart for drinking
purposes by the District Forest Officer.</p>
<p>3. No more than the quantity which the Collector may consider to be
actually required for domestic use shall be removed in the exercise of
the right to take wood, bamboos, fibre, thatching grass, firewood,
roots, fruits, honey and other forest produce. The term &ldquo;other
forest produce&rdquo; shall be taken to mean other minor forest
produce, not including tusks and horns. No wood other than poles and
smaller pieces of third class and unclassified trees shall be
removed.</p>
<p>4. No gudem (Chenchu village) shall, without the special permission
of the Collector, be allowed to keep a larger number of guns than that
for which licenses had been taken out at the time of settlement. Every
gun covered by a license shall be stamped with a distinctive mark or
number. The use of poison and explosives in water, and the setting of
cruives or fixed engines, or snares for the capture or destruction of
fish, are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>5. For purposes of re-generation, a portion of the area set apart
for the grazing of cattle, not exceeding one-fifth, may be closed to
grazing at any time, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>for such length of time as the
District Forest Officer deems fit.</p>
<p>6. The right of pre-emption of all minor forest produce collected by
the Chenchus for sale or barter shall be reserved to the Forest
department. The exercise of the right of collecting wood and other
produce for domestic use, and of collecting minor produce for sale or
barter, shall be confined to natural growth, and shall not include
forest produce which is the result of special plantation or protection
on the part of the Forest department.</p>
<p>In connection with a scheme for dealing with the minor forest
produce in the Nallamalais, the Conservator of Forests wrote as follows
in 1905. &ldquo;I believe that it is generally recognised that it is
imperative to obtain the good-will of the Chenchus even at a
considerable loss, both from a political and from a forest point of
view; the latter being that, if we do not do so, the whole of the
Nallamalai forests will, at a not very remote date, be utterly
destroyed by fire. The Chenchus, being a most abnormal type of men,
must be treated in an abnormal way; and the proposals are based,
therefore, on the fundamental principle of allowing the two District
Forest Officers a very free hand in dealing with these people. What is
mainly asked for is to make an experiment, of endeavouring to get the
Chenchus to collect minor produce for the department, the District
Forest Officers being allowed to fix the remuneration as they like, in
money or barter, as they may from time to time find on the spot to be
best.&rdquo; In commenting on the scheme, the Board of Revenue stated
that &ldquo;action on the lines proposed is justified by the present
state of the Nallamalais. These valuable forests certainly stand in
danger of rapid destruction by fire, and, according to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>the
local officers, the Chenchus are almost entirely responsible. The
department has at present no means of bringing influence to bear on the
Chenchus, or securing their assistance in putting out fires. Repressive
measures will be worse than useless, as the Chenchus will merely hide
themselves, and do more damage than ever. The only way of getting into
touch with them is to enforce the right of pre-emption in the matter of
minor produce reserved to Government at the time of forest settlement,
and by dealing with them in a just and generous way to secure their
confidence. If this is achieved, the department may hope to secure
their co-operation and valuable assistance in preventing jungle fires.
The department can certainly afford to sell at a profit, and at the
same time give the Chenchus better prices than the sowcars
(money-lenders), who are said invariably to cheat them. The Board
believes that the ultimate loss from advances will not be serious, as
advances will ordinarily be small in amount, except in cases where they
may be required by Chenchus to pay off sowcars. It will be well,
therefore, if the Collector and the District Forest Officers will
ascertain as soon as possible how much the Chenchus are indebted to the
sowcars, as it will probably be necessary for the success of the scheme
to liquidate these debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a note on the Chenchus of the Nallamalai hills, I gather that
&ldquo;a striking contrast is afforded between those who inhabit the
belt of forest stretching from Venkatapuram to Bairnuti, and those who
dwell in the jungle on the skirts of the great trunk road, which formed
the chief means of communication between the principal towns until the
Southern Mahratta railway diverted traffic into another channel. In the
former we behold the Chenchu semi-civilised and clothed. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>possesses flocks and herds, smiling fields and
even gardens, and evinces an aptitude for barter. The superiority of
the Bairnuti Chenchu has been brought about by the influence, example,
labours, and generosity of a single Englishman, who built a substantial
stone dwelling in the depths of the great Bairnuti forest. There also
he erected indigo vats, and planted indigo, and a grove of choice mango
grafts, orange and lime trees. He bought buffaloes, and by careful
selection and breeding evolved a magnificent type. These buffaloes have
now become almost entirely fruit-eaters, and are engaged in seeking for
and devouring the forest fruits, which&mdash;particularly the mowhra
and forest fig&mdash;litter the ground in vast quantities. This habit
of fruit-eating imparts to their milk a peculiarly rich nutty flavour,
and the cream is of abnormally rich quality. The Chenchus manufacture
this into ghee (clarified butter), which they turn to profitable
account. The brethren of the Bairnuti Chenchus dwelling in the forest
of Pacherla present very different conditions of life. They accentuate
their nakedness by a narrow bark thread bound round the waist, into
which are thrust their arrows and knife. This is their full dress. The
hair, they aver, is the great and natural covering of mankind. Why,
therefore, violate the ordinary laws of nature by inventing
supererogatory clothing? A missionary sportsman was fairly non-plussed
by these arguments, particularly when his interlocutors pointed to a
celebrated pass or gorge, through which the amorous Kristna is averred
to have pursued and captured a fascinating Chenchu damsel. &lsquo;You
see,&rsquo; said the Chenchu logician, &lsquo;the beauty of her form
was so manifest in its rude simplicity that even the god could not
resist it.&rsquo; <i>En passant</i> it may be noted that, when a
Chenchu wishes to express superlative <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>admiration of a belle, he
compares her to a monkey. In his eyes, the supremest beauty of
femininity is agility. The girl who can shin up a lofty tree, and bring
him down fruit to eat is the acme of feminine perfection. &lsquo;Ah, my
sweet monkey girl,&rsquo; said a demoralised Chenchu, who was too idle
to climb up a tree himself, &lsquo;she has been climbing trees all day,
and throwing me fruit. There is not a man in the forest who can climb
like my monkey girl.&rsquo; The Chenchus are wisely employed by the
authorities as road-police or Tali&#257;ris, to prevent highway
dacoities. This is an astute piece of diplomacy. The Chenchus
themselves are the only dacoits thereabouts, and the salary paid them
as road-police is virtually blackmail to induce them to guarantee the
freedom of the forest highways. The Chenchu barters the produce of the
forests in which he lives, namely, honey and wax, deer horns and hides,
tamarinds, wood apples (<i>Feronia elephantum</i>), and mowhra
(<i>Bassia latifolia</i>) fruit and flowers, and realises a very
considerable income from these sources. He reaps annually a rich
harvest of hides and horns. The s&#257;mbur (<i>Cervus unicolor</i>)
and spotted deer (<i>Cervus axis</i>) shed their horns at certain
seasons. These horns are hidden in the rank luxuriant grass. But, when
the heat of the dry weather has withered it, the Chenchu applies fire
to it by rubbing two dried sticks together, and, walking in the wake of
the flames, picks up the horns disclosed to view by the reduction of
the vegetation to ashes. He supplements this method with his bow and
rifle, and by the latter means alone obtains his hides. The Chenchu is
every bit as bad a shot as the average aboriginal. He rarely stalks,
but, when he does, he makes up by his skill in woodcraft for his
inexpertness with his gun. He understands the importance of not giving
the deer a slant of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36"
name="pb36">36</a>]</span>his wind, and, if they catch a glimpse of
him, he will stand motionless and black as the tree trunks around. The
ambush by the salt-lick or water-hole, however, is his favourite method
of sport. Here, fortified with a supply of the pungent-smelling liquor
which he illicitly distils from the mowhra flower he will lie night and
day ruthlessly murdering s&#257;mbur, spotted deer, nilgai
(<i>Boselaphus tr&agrave;gocamelus</i>); four-horned antelope
(<i>Tetracerus quadricornis</i>). Tigers often stalk down, and drink
and roll in the pool, but the Chenchu dares not draw a bead on him.
Perhaps the indifference of his shooting, of which he is conscious,
deters him.&rdquo; When in danger from tigers or leopards, the Chenchus
climb a tree, and shout. The Chenchus recognise two distinct varieties
of leopards called chirra puli and chirta puli, concerning which
Blanford writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e963src" href=
"#xd21e963" name="xd21e963src">21</a> &ldquo;Most of the sportsmen who
have hunted in Central India, and many native shik&#257;ris (sportsmen)
distinguish two forms, and in parts of the country there is some
appearance of two races&mdash;a larger form that inhabits the hills and
forests, and a smaller form commonly occurring in patches of grass and
bushes amongst cultivated fields and gardens. The larger form is said
to have a shorter tail, a longer head with an occipital crest, and
clearly defined spots on a paler ground-colour. The smaller form has a
comparatively longer tail, a rounder head, less clearly defined spots,
and rougher fur. I cannot help suspecting that the difference is very
often due to age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e968width" id="pl2-035"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Chenchu tree-climbing.</p>
</div>
<p>A Chenchu who was asked by me whether they kill wild beasts replied
that they are wild beasts themselves. In devouring a feast of mutton
provided for those who were my guests in camp, they certainly behaved
as such, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>gnawing at the bones and tearing off the flesh. To
the Chenchus a feast, on however liberal a scale the food may be, is
nothing without a copious supply of toddy, of which even infants
receive a small share. In the absence of toddy, they sometimes
manufacture illicit liquor from the flower-buds of the mahua (or
mowhra) tree. The man who gained the prize (a coarse cotton cloth) in a
shooting match with bow and arrow, with the head of a straw scarecrow
as bull&rsquo;s-eye, was in an advanced stage of intoxication, and used
his success as an argument in favour of drink. In a long distance
shooting match, the prize was won with a carry of 144 yards, the arrow
being shot high into the air. It was noted by Captain Newbold that the
Chenchus are not remarkably expert as archers, to judge from the
awkwardness they exhibited in dispatching an unfortunate sheep picketed
for them at forty yards, which was held out to them as the prize for
the best marksman. Some time ago a Chenchu, who was the bully of his
settlement, beat another Chenchu and his wife. The injured man appealed
to the District Forest Officer, and, explaining that he knew the law
did not allow him to kill his enemy, applied for a written permit to go
after him with a bow and arrow.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e977width" id="pl2-037"><img src=
"images/pl2-037.jpg" alt="Chenchu." width="523" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Chenchu.</p>
</div>
<p>Some Chenchus bear on the head a cap made of wax-cloth, deer or hare
skin. By the more fashionable the tufted ear or bushy tail-end of the
large Indian squirrel (<i>Sciurus Indicus</i>) is attached by way of
ornament to the string with which the hair of the head is tied into a
bunch behind. Leafy garments have been replaced by white loin-cloths,
and some of the women have adopted the ravik&#275; (bodice), in
imitation of the female costume in the plains. Boys, girls, and women
wear bracelets made of <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> or palmyra palm leaves. By
some pieces of stick strung on a thread, or seeds of <i>Givotia
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>rottleriformis</i>, are worn as a charm to ward
off various forms of pain. Some of the women are tattooed on the
forehead, corners of the eyes, and arms. And I saw a few men tattooed
on the shoulder as a cure for rheumatism.</p>
<p>The huts of which a present day gudem is composed are either in the
shape of bee-hives like those of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis, or oblong with
sloping roof, and situated in a grove near a pond or stream. The staple
food of the Chenchus consists of cereals, supplemented by yams
(<i>Dioscorea</i>) which are uprooted with a digging-stick tipped with
iron, forest fruits, and various animals such as peacock, crow, lizard
(<i>Varanus</i>), bear, and black monkey. They are very fond of the
young flowers and buds of the mahua tree, and tamarind fruits, the
acidity of which is removed by mixing with them the ashes of the bark
of the same tree.</p>
<p>The forest products collected by the Chenchus include myrabolams,
fruits of the tamarind, <i>Semecarpus anacardi&uacute;m</i>,
<i>Sapindus trifoliatus</i> (soap-nut), <i>Buchanania latifolia</i>,
<i>Buchanania angustifolia</i>, and <i>Ficus glomerata</i>; roots of
<i>Aristolochia Indica</i> and <i>Hemidesmus Indicus</i>; seeds of
<i>Abrus precatorius</i>; flowers of <i>Bassia latifolia</i>; horns,
and honey.</p>
<p>The Chenchus recognise two kinds of bees, large and small, and
gather honey from nests in trees or rocks. It is stated in the Cuddapah
Manual that &ldquo;the Yen&#257;dis or Chenchus alone are able to climb
miraculously into difficult and apparently inaccessible places, and
over perpendicular cliffs in some places from a hundred to two hundred
feet high. This they do by means of a plaited rope made of young
bamboos tied together. Accidents sometimes happen by the rope giving
way. It is a nervous sight to watch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>them climbing up and down this
frail support. From below the men look like little babies hanging
midway. The rope being fastened on the top of the cliff by means of a
peg driven into the ground or by a tree, the man swings suspended in
the air armed with a basket and a stick. The Chenchu first burns some
brushwood or grass under the hive, which is relinquished by most of the
bees. This accomplished, he swings the rope, until it brings him close
to the hive, which he pokes with his stick, at the same time holding
out his basket to catch the pieces broken off from the hive. When the
basket is full, he shakes the rope, and is drawn up (generally by his
wife&rsquo;s brother). The bamboo ropes are never taken away; nor are
they used a second time, a fresh one being made on each occasion, and
at each place. They are to be seen hanging for years, until they decay
and fall down of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like other Telugu classes, the Chenchus have exogamous septs or
intip&#275;ru, of which the following are examples:&mdash;gurram
(horse), arati (plantain tree), m&#257;nla (trees), t&#333;ta (garden),
m&#275;kala (goats), indla (houses), savaram (sovereign, gold coin),
and gundam (pit).</p>
<p>Of the marriage customs the following account is given in the
Kurnool Manual. &ldquo;The Chenchus do not follow a uniform custom in
respect to marriage ceremonies. Their marriage is performed in three
ways. A man wishing to marry selects his own bride, and both retire for
one night by mutual consent from the gudem. On the following morning,
when they return, their parents invite their friends and relatives, and
by formally investing them with new clothes, declare them duly married.
To complete the ceremony, a meal is given to those assembled. The
second method is as follows. A small space, circular in form, is
cleaned and besmeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>with cowdung. In the centre a bow and arrow
tied together are fixed in the ground, and the bride and bridegroom are
made to move round it, when the men assembled bless them by throwing
some rice over them, and the marriage is complete. According to the
third mode, a Br&#257;hmin is consulted by the elders of the family. An
auspicious day is fixed, and a raised pial (platform) is formed, on
which the bride and bridegroom being seated, a t&#257;li (marriage
badge) is tied, and rice poured over their heads. The services of the
Br&#257;hmin are engaged for three or four days, and are rewarded with
a piece of new cloth and some money. This ceremony resembles that of
the ryot (cultivating) class among the Hindus. It is evidently a recent
Brahminical innovation. On marriage occasions generally tom-toms, if
available, are beaten, and a dance takes place.&rdquo; In the second
form of marriage, as described to me, the bride and bridegroom sit
opposite each other with four arrows stuck in the ground between them.
In Mackenzie&rsquo;s record it is stated that the Chenchus make the
bridal pair sit with a single arrow between them, and, when there is no
shadow, some elderly men and women throw rice over their heads. The
importance of the arrow with the Chenchus, as with the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis, is that the moment when it casts no shadow is the
auspicious time for the completion of the marriage rite. The remarriage
of widows is permitted, and the second husband is said to be in most
cases a brother of the deceased one.</p>
<p>As an example of the Chenchu songs, the following marriage song,
sung by two men and a woman, and recorded by my phonograph, may be
cited:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">At a dance in my honour, men and women executed a
series of step dances in time with a drum (thappata) resembling a big
tambourine, which, at the conclusion of each dance, was passed to and
fro through a blazing fire of cholum straw to bring it up to the proper
pitch. An elderly hag went through a variety of gesticulations like
those of a D&#275;va-d&#257;si (dancing-girl). A man dressed up in
straw and fragments of mats picked up near my camp, and another
disguised as a woman, with bells round his ankles, supplied the comic

<p>In the Kurnool Manual it is stated that &ldquo;as soon as a child is
born, the umbilical cord is cut (with a knife or arrow), and the child
is washed in cold or hot water, according as the season is hot or cold.
On the third day, all the women of the tribe are invited, and served
with betel nut. On the fourth day, an old woman gives a name to the
child. The baby is generally laid in a cradle made of deer skins, and
suspended from a bamboo by means of strings or dusara
creepers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead are carried to the burial-place in a cloth slung on a pole.
The body, after it has been laid in the grave, is covered over with
leafy twigs, and the grave is filled in. The spot is marked by a mound
of earth and stones piled up. On the second or third day, some cooked
food is offered to the soul of the deceased person, near the grave,
and, after some of it has been set apart for the crows, the remainder
is buried in the mound or within the grave. The same rite is repeated
after the eighth day.</p>
<p>The Chenchus are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1127src" href=
"#xd21e1127" name="xd21e1127src">25</a>, like the Y&#257;n&#257;dis, to
worship a god called Chenchu D&#275;vata, to whom offerings of honey
and fruits are sometimes made. They believe, as has been mentioned
already, that the god Narasimha of Ah&#333;bilam, whom they call
&#332;bal&#275;sudu, carried off a beautiful Chenchu girl, named
Chenchita, and married her. To prevent the occurrence of a similar fate
to other females of the tribe, Chenchita ordained that they should in
future be born ugly, and be devoid of personal charms. The Chenchus
claim &#332;bal&#275;sudu as their brother-in-law, and, when they go to
the temple for the annual festival, carry cloths as presents for the
god and goddess. The legend of their origin is told as follows
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>by Captain Newbold. &ldquo;Previous to the
incarnation of Sri Krishna in the Dwapara Yug (the third of the great
ages), the Chenchwars were shepherds of the Yerra Golla caste. Obal
Iswara, the sw&#257;mi (deity) of Obalam, a celebrated hill shrine in
the Nalla Mallas, having taken away and kept as a Chenchita a maid of
the Yerra Golla family, begat upon her children, of whom they are
descendants.&rdquo; Among other minor deities, the Chenchus are said to
worship Ankalamma, Potu R&#257;zu, Sunkalamma, Mallamma, and
Guruppa.</p>
<p>In the absence of lucifer matches, the Chenchus make fire with flint
and steel, and the slightly charred floss of the white cotton tree,
<i>Eriodendron anfractuosum</i>, I am informed that, like the Paniyans
of Malabar, they also obtain fire by friction, by means of the
horizontal or sawing method, with two pieces of split bamboo.</p>
<p>Some Chenchus still exhibit the primitive short stature and high
nasal index, which are characteristic of other jungle tribes such as
the K&#257;dirs, Paniyans, and Kurumbas. But there is a very
conspicuous want of uniformity in their physical characters, and many
individuals are to be met with, above middle height or tall, with long
narrow noses. A case is noted in the Kurnool Manual, in which a
brick-maker married a Chenchu girl. And I was told of a B&#333;ya man
who had married into the tribe, and was living in a gudem. In this way
is the pure type of Chenchu metamorphosed.</p>

<p>The visual acuity of the Chenchus was tested with Cohn&rsquo;s
letter E, No. 6. For clinical purposes, the visual acuity would be

<p>In all classes, it may be noted, the average acuity was between 12
and 13 metres (13 to 14 yards), and ranged between V.A. = 2&middot;15
and V.A. = 2&middot;03. The maxima distances, at which the position of
the letter was recognised, were:&mdash;Sh&#333;laga, 18m; Paraiyan,
19m; Badaga and D&#299;kshitar Br&#257;hman, 20m. No cases of
extraordinary hyper-acuity were met with. The nine classes, or groups
of classes examined, cover a wide range of degrees of civilisation from
the wild jungle Chenchus, Sh&#333;lagas, and Ur&#257;lis, to the
cultured Br&#257;hman. And, though the jungle man, who has to search
for his food and mark the tracks and traces of wild beasts, undoubtedly
possesses a specially trained keenness of vision for the exigencies of
his primitive life, the figures show that, as regards ordinary visual
acuity, he has no advantage over the more highly civilised classes.</p>
<p>There were, in 1904&ndash;05, two Board upper primary schools for
the Chenchus of the Kurnool district, which were attended by
seventy-three pupils, who were fed and clothed, and supplied with books
and slates free of charge.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#275;nu</b> (dry field).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kamma.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#275;pp&#257;t.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of
M&#257;r&#257;n.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#275;ruk&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census
Report, 1901, as a sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Cheruku.</b>&mdash;Cheruku (sugar-cane) or Cherukula has been
recorded as an exogamous sept of B&#333;ya, J&#333;gi and Odde.</p>
<p><b>Cheruman.</b>&mdash;The Cherumans or Cherumukkal have been
defined as a Malay&#257;lam caste of agricultural serfs, and as members
of an inferior caste in Malabar, who are, as a rule, toilers attached
to the soil. In the Madras Census Report, 1891, it is stated that
&ldquo;this caste is called Cheruman in South Malabar and Pulayan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>in North Malabar. Even in South Malabar where they
are called Cheruman, a large sub-division numbering over 30,000 is
called Pula Cheruman. The most important of the sub-divisions returned
are Kanakkan, Pula Cheruman, Er&#257;lan, K&#363;d&#257;n and
R&#333;lan. Kanakkan and Pula Cheruman are found in all the southern
t&#257;luks, K&#363;d&#257;n almost wholly in Walluvan&#257;d, and
Er&#257;lan in P&#257;lghat and Walluvan&#257;d.&rdquo; In the Census
Report, 1901, &#256;lan (slave), and Paramban are given as sub-castes
of Cheruman.</p>
<p>According to one version, the name Cheruma or Cheramakkal signifies
sons of the soil; and, according to another, Cheriamakkal means little
children, as Parasur&#257;ma directed that they should be cared for,
and treated as such. The word Pulayan is said to be derived from pula,
meaning pollution.</p>
<p>Of the Cherumans, the following account is given in the Gazetteer of
Malabar. &ldquo;They are said to be divided into 39 divisions, the more
important of which are the Kanakka Cherumans, the Pula Cherumans or
Pulayas, the Era Cherumans or Er&#257;lans, the R&#333;li Cherumans or
R&#333;lans, and the K&#363;d&#257;ns. Whether these sub-divisions
should be treated as separate castes or not, it is hardly possible to
determine; some of them at least are endogamous groups, and some are
still further sub-divided. Thus the Pulayas of Chirakkal are said to be
divided into one endogamous and eleven exogamous groups, called
M&#257;vadan, Elaman&#257;m, Tacchakudiyan, Kundat&#333;n, Cheruvulan,
Mulattan, T&#257;lan, Vannatam, Eram&#257;l&#333;diyan, Mullaviriyan,
Egudan, and Kund&#333;n. Some at least of these group names obviously
denote differences of occupation. The Kund&#333;tti, or woman of the
last group, acts as midwife; and in consequence the group is considered
to convey pollution by touch to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>members of the other groups, and
they will neither eat nor marry with those belonging to it. Death or
birth pollution is removed by a member of the M&#257;vadan class called
Maruttan, who sprinkles cowdung mixed with water on the feet, and milk
on the head of the person to be purified. At weddings, the Maruttan
receives 32 fanams, the prescribed price of a bride, from the
bridegroom, and gives it to the bride&rsquo;s people. The Era Cherumans
and Kanakkans, who are found only in the southern t&#257;luks of the
district, appear to be divided into exogamous groups called
K&#363;ttams, many of which seem to be named after the house-name of
the masters whom they serve. The Cherumans are almost solely employed
as agricultural labourers and coolies; but they also make mats and
baskets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1377src" href="#xd21e1377"
name="xd21e1377src">26</a> by Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer that
&ldquo;from traditions current among the Pulayas, it would appear that,
once upon a time, they had dominion over several parts of the country.
A person called Aikkara Yajaman, whose ancestors were Pulaya kings, is
still held in considerable respect by the Pulayas of North Travancore,
and acknowledged as their chieftain and lord, while the Aikkaran&#257;d
in the Kunnethn&#257;d t&#257;luk still remains to lend colour to the
tale. In Trivandrum, on the banks of the Velli lake, is a hill called
Pulayanar Kotta, where it is believed that a Pulaya king once ruled. In
other places, they are also said to have held sway. As a Paraya found
at Melkota the image of Selvapillai, as a Savara was originally in
possession of the sacred stone which became the idol in the temple of
Jaganath, so also is the worship of Padman&#257;bha at Trivandrum
intimately connected with a Pulayan. Once a Pulaya <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>woman,
who was living with her husband in the Ananthan k&#257;du (jungle),
suddenly heard the cry of a baby. She rushed to the spot, and saw to
her surprise a child lying on the ground, protected by a snake. She
took pity on it, and nursed it like her own child. The appearance of
the snake intimated to her the divine origin of the infant. This proved
to be true, for the child was an incarnation of Vishnu. As soon as the
R&#257;ja of Travancore heard of the wonderful event, he built a shrine
on the spot where the baby had been found, and dedicated it to
Padman&#257;bha. The Pulayas round Trivandrum assert to this day that,
in former times, a Pulaya king ruled, and had his castle not far from
the present capital of Travancore. The following story is also current
among them. The Pulayas got from the god Siva a boon, with spade and
axe, to clear forests, own lands, and cultivate them. When other people
took possession of them, they were advised to work under
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Mr. Logan,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1384src" href=
"#xd21e1384" name="xd21e1384src">27</a> the Cherumans are of two
sections, one of which, the Iraya, are of slightly higher social
standing than the Pulayan. &ldquo;As the names denote, the former are
permitted to come as far as the eaves (ira) of their employers&rsquo;
houses, while the latter name denotes that they convey pollution to all
whom they meet or approach.&rdquo; The name Cheruman is supposed to be
derived from cheru, small, the Cheruman being short of stature, or from
chera, a dam or low-lying rice field. Mr. Logan, however, was of
opinion that there is ample evidence that &ldquo;the Malabar coast at
one time constituted the kingdom or Empire of Ch&#275;ra, and the
n&#257;d or county of Ch&#275;ran&#257;d lying on the coast and inland
south-east of Calicut remains to the present day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>to give
a local habitation to the ancient name. Moreover, the name of the great
Emperor of Malabar, who is known to every child on the coast as
Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perumal, was undoubtedly the title and not the name
of the Emperor, and meant the chief (literally, big man) of the
Ch&#275;ra people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the history of slavery in Malabar an admirable account is given
by Mr. Logan, from which the following extracts are taken. &ldquo;In
1792, the year in which British rule commenced, a proclamation was
issued against dealing in slaves. In 1819, the principal Collector
wrote a report on the condition of the Cherumar, and received orders
that the practice of selling slaves for arrears of revenue be
immediately discontinued. In 1821, the Court of Directors expressed
considerable dissatisfaction at the lack of precise information which
had been vouchsafed to them, and said &lsquo;We are told that part of
the cultivators are held as slaves: that they are attached to the soil,
and marketable property.&rsquo; In 1836, the Government ordered the
remission in the Collector&rsquo;s accounts of Rs.
927&ndash;13&ndash;0, which was the annual revenue from slaves on the
Government lands in Malabar, and the Government was at the same time
&lsquo;pleased to accede to the recommendation in favour of
emancipating the slaves on the Government lands in Malabar.&rsquo; In
1841, Mr. E. B. Thomas, the Judge at Calicut, wrote in strong terms a
letter to the Sadr Ad&#257;lat, in which he pointed out that women in
some t&#257;luks (divisions) fetched higher prices, in order to breed
slaves; that the average cost of a young male under ten years was about
Rs. 3&ndash;8&ndash;0, of a female somewhat less; that an infant ten
months old was sold in a court auction for Rs. 1&ndash;10&ndash;6
independent of the price of its mother; and that, in a recent suit, the
right to twenty-seven slaves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>was the &lsquo;sole matter of
litigation, and was disposed of on its merits.&rsquo; In a further
letter, Mr. Thomas pointed out that the slaves had increased in numbers
from 144,000 at the Census, 1835, to 159,000 at the Census, 1842. It
was apparently these letters which decided the Board of Directors to
send out orders to legislate. And the Government of India passed Act V
of 1843, of which the provisions were widely published through Malabar.
The Collector explained to the Cherumar that it was in their interest,
as well as their duty, to remain with their masters, if kindly treated.
He proclaimed that &lsquo;the Government will not order a slave who is
in the employ of an individual to forsake him and go to the service of
another claimant; nor will the Government interfere with the
slave&rsquo;s inclination as to where he wishes to work.&rsquo; And
again, &lsquo;Any person claiming a slave as janmam, k&#257;nam or
panayam, the right of such claim or claims will not be investigated
into at any one of the public offices or courts.&rsquo; In 1852, and
again in 1855, the fact that traffic in slaves still continued was
brought to the notice of Government, but on full consideration no
further measures for the emancipation of the Cherumar were deemed to be
necessary. The Cherumar even yet have not realised what public opinion
in England would probably have forced down their throats fifty years
ago, and there is reason to think that they are still, even now, with
their full consent bought and sold and hired out, although, of course,
the transaction must be kept secret for fear of the penalties of the
Penal Code, which came into force in 1862, and was the real final blow
at slavery in India. The slaves, however, as a caste will never
understand what real freedom means, until measures are adopted to give
them indefeasible rights in the small orchards occupied by them as
house-sites.&rdquo; It is noted by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer that
&ldquo;though slavery has been abolished many years ago, the name
valliyal (a person receiving valli, <i>i.e.</i>, paddy given to a
slave) still survives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the Penal Code it is enacted that&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Whoever imports, exports, removes, buys, sells, or
disposes of any person as a slave, or accepts, receives, or detains
against his will any person as a slave, shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also
be liable to a fine.</p>
<p>Whoever habitually imports, exports, removes, buys, sells, traffics
or deals in slaves, shall be punished with transportation for life, or
with imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall be
liable to a fine.</p>
<p>Whoever unlawfully compels any person to labour against the will of
that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to one year, or with a fine, or with both.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very low indeed,&rdquo; Mr. S. Appadorai Iyer
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1411src" href="#xd21e1411" name=
"xd21e1411src">28</a> &ldquo;is the social position of these miserable
beings. When a Cherumar meets a person of superior caste; he must stand
at a distance of thirty feet. If he comes within this prohibited
distance, his approach is said to cause pollution, which is removed
only by bathing in water. A Cherumar cannot approach a Br&#257;hman
village or temple, or tank. If he does so, purification becomes
necessary. Even while using the public road, if he sees his lord and
master, he has to leave the ordinary way and walk, it may be in the
mud, to avoid his displeasure by accidentally polluting him. To avoid
polluting the passer-by, he repeats the unpleasant sound &lsquo;O, oh,
O&mdash;&rsquo;. [In some places, <i>e.g.</i>, Palgh&#257;t, one may
often see a Cheruman with a dirty piece of cloth spread <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>on the
roadside, and yelling in a shrill voice &lsquo;Ambr&#257;ne,
Ambar&#257;ne, give me some pice, and throw them on the cloth.&rsquo;]
His position is intolerable in the Native States of Cochin and
Travancore, where Br&#257;hman influence is in the ascendant; while in
the Palgh&#257;t t&#257;luk the Cherumars cannot, even to this day,
enter the bazaar.&rdquo; A melancholy picture has been drawn of the
Cherumans tramping along the marshes in mud, often wet up to their
waists, to avoid polluting their superiors. In 1904, a Cheruman came
within polluting distance of a N&#257;yar, and was struck with a stick.
The Cheruman went off and fetched another, whereupon the N&#257;yar ran
away. He was, however, pursued by the Cherumans. In defending himself
with a spade, the N&#257;yar struck the foremost Cheruman on the head,
and killed him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1419src" href="#xd21e1419"
name="xd21e1419src">29</a> In another case, a Cheruman, who was the
servant of a M&#257;ppilla, was fetching grass for his master, when he
inadvertently approached some Tiyans, and thereby polluted them. The
indignant Tiyans gave not only the Cheruman, but his master also, a
sound beating by way of avenging the insult offered to them.</p>
<p>The status of the Pulayas of the Cochin State is thus described by
Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer. &ldquo;They abstain from eating food prepared
by the Velakkathalavans (barbers), Mannans (washermen),
P&#257;n&#257;ns, Vettuvans, Parayans, Nay&#257;dis, Ulladans,
Malayans, and K&#257;dars. The Pulayas in the southern parts of the
State have to stand at a distance of 90 feet from Br&#257;hmans and 64
feet from N&#257;yars, and this distance gradually diminishes towards
the lower castes. They are polluted by Pula Cherumas, Parayas,
Nay&#257;dis, and Ulladans. [The Pula Cherumas are said to eat beef,
and sell the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>hides of cattle.] The Kanakka Cherumas of the
Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk pollute Era Cherumas and Konga Cherumas by
touch, and by approach within a distance of seven or eight feet, and
are themselves polluted by Pula Cherumas, Parayas, and Vettuvans, who
have to stand at the same distance. Pulayas and Vettuvans bathe when
they approach one another, for their status is a point of dispute as to
which is superior to the other. When defiled by the touch of a
Nay&#257;di, a Cheruman has to bathe in seven tanks, and let a few
drops of blood flow from one of his fingers. A Br&#257;hman who enters
the compound of a Pulayan has to change his holy thread, and take
panchagavyam (the five products of the cow) so as to be purified from
pollution. The Valluva Pulayan of the Trich&#363;r t&#257;luk fasts for
three days, if he happens to touch a cow that has been delivered of a
calf. He lives on toddy and tender cocoanuts. He has also to fast three
days after the delivery of his wife.&rdquo; In ordinary conversation in
Malabar, such expressions as Tiya-p&#257;d or Cheruma-p&#257;d (that
is, the distance at which a Tiyan or Cheruman has to keep) are said to
be commonly used.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1426src" href="#xd21e1426"
name="xd21e1426src">30</a></p>
<p>By Mr. T. K. Gopal Panikkar the Cherumans are described<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1431src" href="#xd21e1431" name=
"xd21e1431src">31</a> as &ldquo;a very inferior race, who are regarded
merely as agricultural instruments in the hands of the landlords their
masters, who supply them with houses on their estates. Their daily
maintenance is supplied to them by their masters themselves. Every
morning the master&rsquo;s agent summons them to his house, and takes
them away to work in the fields, in ploughing, drawing water from
wells, and in short doing the whole of the cultivation. In the evening
a certain quantity of paddy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=
"#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>(unhusked rice) is distributed to
them as wages. Both theory and practice, in the great majority of
cases, are that they are fed at the master&rsquo;s cost the whole year
round, whether they work in the fields or not. But it is very seldom
that they can have a holiday, regard being had to the nature of
agriculture in Malabar. It is the Cheruma that should plough the land,
sow the seed, transplant the seedlings, regulate the flow of water in
the fields, uproot the weeds, and see that the crops are not destroyed
by animals, or stolen. When the crops ripen, he has to keep watch at
night. The sentry house consists of a small oval-shaped portable roof,
constructed of palmyra and cocoanut leaves, supported by four posts,
across which are tied bamboos, which form the watchman&rsquo;s bed.
Wives sometimes accompany their husbands in their watches. When the
harvest season approaches, the Cheruman&rsquo;s hands are full. He has
to cut the crops, carry them to the barn (kalam), separate the corn
from the stalk, and winnow it. The second crop operations immediately
follow, and the Cheruma has to go through all these processes again. It
is in the summer season that his work is light, when he is set to
prepare vegetable gardens, or some odd job is found for him by his
master. The old, infirm, and the children look after their
master&rsquo;s cattle. Receiving his daily pittance of paddy, the
Cheruman enters his hut, and reserves a portion of it for the purchase
of salt, chillies, toddy, tobacco, and dried fish. The other portion is
reserved for food. The Cheruman spends the greater part of his wages on
toddy. It is a very common sight in Malabar to see a group of
Cherumans, including women and children, sitting in front of a toddy
shop, the Cheruman transferring the unfinished portion of the toddy to
his wife, and the latter to the children. A Cheruman, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>however,
rarely gets intoxicated, or commits crime. No recess is allowed to the
Cherumans, except on national holidays and celebrated temple festivals
observed in honour of the goddess Bhagavati or K&#257;li, when they are
quite free to indulge in drink. On these days, their hire is given in
advance. With this they get intoxicated, and go to the poora-paramba or
temple premises, where the festival is celebrated, in batches of four,
each one tying his hands to another&rsquo;s neck, and reciting every
two seconds the peculiar sound:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lall&#275; lall&#275; lall&#275; ho.</p>
<p class="line">Lall&#275; lall&#275; lall&#275; ho.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On the European plantations in the Wyn&#257;d
the Cherumans are in great request, and many are to be seen travelling
nowadays without fear in railway carriages on their way to the
plantations. A few also work in the gold mines of Mysore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like other servile classes, the Cherumans possess special privileges
on special occasions. For example, at the ch&#257;l (furrow) ceremony
in Malabar &ldquo;the master of the house, the cultivating agent, and
Cherumans assemble in the barn, a portion of the yard in front of the
building is painted with rice-water, and a lighted bell-lamp is placed
near at hand with some paddy and rice, and several cups made of the
leaves of the kanniram (<i>Strychnos nux-vomica</i>)&mdash;as many cups
as there are varieties of seed in the barn. Then, placing implicit
faith in his gods, and deceased ancestors, the master of the house
opens the barn door, followed by the Cheruman with a new painted basket
containing the leaf cups. The master then takes a handful of seed from
a seed-basket, and fills one of the cups, and the cultivating agent,
head Cheruman, and others who are interested in a good harvest, fill
the cups till the seeds are exhausted. The basket, with the cups,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>is next taken to the decorated portion of the
yard. A new ploughshare is fastened to a new plough, and a pair of
cattle are brought on to the scene. Plough, cattle, and basket are all
painted with rice-water. A procession proceeds to the fields, on
reaching which the head Cheruman lays down the basket, and makes a
mound of earth with the spade. To this a little manure is added, and
the master throws a handful of seed into it. The cattle are then yoked,
and one turn is ploughed by the head Cheruman. Inside this at least
seven furrows are made, and the plough is dropped to the right. An
offering is made to Ganapathi (the elephant god), and the master throws
some seed into a furrow. Next the head Cheruman calls out &lsquo;May
the gods on high and the deceased ancestors bless the seed, which has
been thrown broadcast, and the cattle which are let loose; the mother
and children of the house, the master, and the slaves, may they also
vouchsafe to us a good crop, good sunshine, and good harvest.&rsquo; A
cocoanut is then cut on the ploughshare, and from the cut portions
several deductions are made. If the hinder part is larger than the
front one, the harvest will be moderate. If the cut passes through the
eyes of the nut, or if no water is left in the cut portions, certain
misfortune is foreboded. The cut fragments are then taken with a little
water inside them, and a leaf of the tulsi plant (<i>Ocimum
sanctum</i>) dropped in. If the leaf turns to the right, a prosperous
harvest is assured; whereas, if it turns to the left, certain calamity
will follow. This ceremonial concluded, there is much shouting, and the
names of all the gods may be heard called out in a confused prayer. The
party then breaks up, and the unused seeds are divided among the
workmen.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1455src" href="#xd21e1455"
name="xd21e1455src">32</a> At <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>the ceremony in Malabar, when the
transplantation of rice is completed, during which a goat is sacrificed
to M&#363;ni, the protector of cattle and field labourers, the
officiating priest is generally the cultivation agent of the family,
who is a N&#257;yar, or sometimes a Cheruman.</p>
<p>In connection with the harvest ceremonial in Cochin, Mr. Anantha
Krishna Iyer writes as follows. &ldquo;There are some curious customs
connected with the harvest, prevailing among the Pulayas of the
southern parts of the State. Before reaping, the Pulaya headman asks
his master whether he may begin to reap. With his permission, he faces
the east, and puts the sickle to the stalks. The first bundle he
reserves for the gods of his master, and the second for those of his
castemen. Before thrashing, the same headman takes a few bundles of
corn from the sheaf intended for their gods, and sprinkles toddy on
them. Another Pulayan does the same for the various reapers, and says,
as he does so &lsquo;Come, thrashing corn, increase.&rsquo; This is
called filling the thrashing floor, and each man thrashes his own
sheaves. When the thrashing is over, the headman puts his
master&rsquo;s sheaf in the centre of the floor, and his own at a short
distance outside, in order that the two sets of gods may look kindly on
them. The headman is privileged to measure the corn sitting with his
two assistants, saying &lsquo;Come, paddy, increase,&rsquo; as he
counts. He also calls out &lsquo;Good paddy, one&rsquo;, &lsquo;bad
paddy, two&rsquo;, and so on, until he counts ten. The eleventh is the
share for the reaper. He takes a handful, and places it in a basket,
half of which falls to him, his assistants and the watchman, while the
other half is given away in charity to the poor men that come to the
thrashing place. In the northern parts of the State, before reaping,
offerings of goats, fowls, and cocoanuts, are made to Mallan and
M&#363;ni. The Cheruma <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"
name="pb58">58</a>]</span>headman faces east, and applies his sickle to
the stalks, reserving the first stalk for the deities above mentioned.
The corn is thrashed and measured by one of them, and, as he does so,
he says &lsquo;Labham&rsquo; (profit) for one, &lsquo;Chetham&rsquo;
(loss) for two, and counts up to ten. The eleventh goes to the share of
the reapers. Thus they get one para for every ten paras of corn. The
poor people that attend are also given a handful of the grain. After
reaping, the members of the castes named in the table below receive a
small portion of the corn for their services rendered to the farmers in
the course of the months during which cultivation has been carried
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pulayans receive, in return for watching, a small portion
of the field near the watchman&rsquo;s rest-hut, which is left unreaped
for him. It fetches him a para of paddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cherumas who are engaged in reaping get two bundles of
corn each for every field. For measuring the corn from the farmyard, a
Cheruman gets an edangazhy of paddy, in addition to his daily wage.
Three paras of paddy are set apart for the local village deity. During
the month of Karkadakam, the masters give every Cheruman a fowl, some
oil, garlic, mustard, anise seeds, pepper, and turmeric. They prepare a
decoction of seeds, and boil the flesh of the fowl in it, which they
take for three days, during which they are allowed to take rest. Three
days&rsquo; wages are also given in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Travancore, a festival named Macam is held, of which the
following account has been published.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1522src" href="#xd21e1522" name="xd21e1522src">33</a> &ldquo;The
Macam (tenth constellation Regulus, which follows Thiru Onam in
August), is regarded by Hindus as a day of great festivity. One must
enjoy it even at the cost of one&rsquo;s children, so runs an adage.
The day is considered to be so lucky that a girl born under the star
Regulus is verily born with a silver spoon in her mouth. It was on
Macam, some say, that the D&#275;vas, to free themselves from the curse
they were put under by a certain sage, had to churn the sea of milk to
procure ambrosia. Be the cause which led to the celebration what it
may, the Hindus of the present day have ever been enthusiastic in its
observance; only some of the rude customs connected with it have died
out in the course of time, or were put a stop to by Government. Sham
fights were, and are still, in some places a feature of the day. Such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>a sham fight used to be carried on at Pallam
until, about a hundred years ago, it was stopped through the
intervention of Colonel Munro, the British Resident in Travancore. The
place is still called Patanilam (battle field), and the tank, on
opposite sides of which the contending parties assembled, Chorakulam
(pool of blood). The steel swords and spears, of curious and various
shapes, and shields large enough to cover a man, are even now preserved
in the local temple. Many lives were lost in these fights. It is not
generally known, even to people in these parts, that a sham fight takes
place on Macam and the previous day every year at a place called
Wezhapra, between the Changanacherry and Ambalapuzha taluks. Three
banyan trees mark the place. People, especially Pulayas and Pariahs, to
the number of many thousands, collect round the outside trees with
steel swords, spears, and slings in their <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1527" title="Source: hand">hands</span>. A small bund
(embankment) separates the two parties. They have to perform certain
religious rites near the tree which stands in the middle, and, in doing
so, make some movements with their swords and spears to the
accompaniment of music. If those standing on one side of the bund cross
it, a regular fight is the result. In order to avoid such things,
without at the same time interfering with their liberty to worship at
the spot, the Government this year made all the necessary arrangements.
The Police were sent for the purpose. Everything went off smoothly but
for one untoward event. The people had been told not to come armed with
steel weapons, but with wooden ones. They had to put them down, and
were then allowed to go and worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of conversion to Muhammadanism at the present time, a good example
is afforded by the Cherumans. &ldquo;This caste,&rdquo; the Census
Superintendent, 1881, writes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>&ldquo;numbered 99,009 in Malabar at
the census of 1871, and, in 1881, is returned as only 64,735. There are
40,000 fewer Cherumans than there would have been but for some
disturbing influence, and this is very well known to be conversion to
Muhammadanism. The honour of Islam once conferred on the Cheruman, he
moves at one spring several places higher than that which he originally
occupied.&rdquo; &ldquo;Conversion to Muhammadanism,&rdquo; Mr. Logan
writes, &ldquo;has had a marked effect in freeing the slave caste in
Malabar from their former burthens. By conversion a Cheruman obtains a
distinct rise in the social scale, and, if he is in consequence bullied
or beaten, the influence of the whole Muhammadan community comes to his
aid.&rdquo; It has been noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1535src" href=
"#xd21e1535" name="xd21e1535src">34</a> that Cheruman converts to Islam
take part in the Moplah (M&#257;ppilla) outbreaks, which from time to
time disturb the peace of Malabar.</p>
<p>The home of the Cheruman is called a ch&#257;la or hut, which has a
thatched roof of grass and palm-leaves resembling an immense bee-hive.
A big underground cell, with a ceiling of planks, forms the granary of
the occupants of these huts. The chief house furniture consists of a
pestle and mortar, and two or three earthenware pots.</p>
<p>The habitations of the Pulayas of Cochin are thus described by Mr.
Anantha Krishna Iyer. &ldquo;Their huts are generally called madams,
which are put up on the banks of fields, in the middle of rice flats,
or on trees along their borders, so as to enable them to watch the
crops after the toils of the day. They are discouraged from erecting
better huts, under the idea that, if settled more comfortably, they
would be less inclined to move <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>as cultivation required. The
madams are very poor huts, supported on four small posts, and thatched
with leaves. The sides are protected with the same kind of leaves.
There is only one room, and the floor, though slightly raised, is very
damp during the rainy months. These temporary buildings are removed
after the harvest, and put up in places where cultivation has to be
carried on. All the members of the family sleep together in the same
hut. Small temporary huts are sometimes erected, which are little
better than inverted baskets. These are placed in the rice field while
the crop is on the ground, and near the stacks while it is being
thrashed. In the northern parts of the State, the Pulaya huts are made
of mud walls, and provided with wooden doors. The roofs are of bamboo
framework thatched with palmyra palm leaves. The floor is raised, and
the huts are provided with pyals (raised platforms) on three sides.
They have also small compounds (grounds) around them. There is only one
room inside, which is the sleeping apartment of the newly married
youngsters. The others, I am told, sleep on the verandahs. The utensils
consist of a few earthen pots for cooking and keeping water, and a few
earthen dishes for taking food. In addition to these, I found a wooden
mortar, a few pestles, two pans, two winnowing pans, a fish basket for
each woman, a few cocoanut shells for keeping salt and other things, a
few baskets of their own making, in one of which a few dirty cloths
were placed, some mats of their own making, a bamboo vessel for
measuring corn, and a vessel for containing toddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the rainy season, the Cherumas in the field wear a few
green leaves, especially those of the plantain tree, tied round their
waists, and a small cone-shaped cap, made of plantain leaf, is worn on
the head. This practice, among the females, has fallen into disuse in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>Malabar, though it is to some extent still found
in the Native States. The Cherumi is provided with one long piece of
thick cloth, which she wraps round her waist, and which does not even
reach the knees. She does not cover the chest.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1551src" href="#xd21e1551" name="xd21e1551src">35</a> The
Cheruma females have been described as wearing, when at work in the
open, a big oval-shaped handleless umbrella covered with palm leaves,
which they place on their back, and which covers the whole of their
person in the stooping attitude. The men use, during the rainy season,
a short-handled palm-leaf umbrella.</p>
<p>The women are profusely decorated with cheap jewelry of which the
following are examples:</p>
<p>1. Lobes of both ears widely dilated by rolled leaden ornaments.
Brass, and two glass bead necklets, string necklet with flat brass
ornaments, the size of a Venetian sequin, with device as in old
Travancore gold coins, with two brass cylinders pendent behind, and
tassels of red cotton. Three brass rings on right little finger; two on
left ring finger, one brass and two steel bangles on left wrist.</p>
<p>2. Several bead necklets, and a single necklet of many rows of
beads. Brass necklet like preceding, with steel prong and scoop, for
removing wax from the ears and picking teeth, tied to one of the
necklets. Attached to, and pendent from one necklet, three palm leaf
rolls with symbols and Malay&#257;lam inscription to act as a charm in
driving away devils. Three ornamental brass bangles on right forearm,
two on left. Iron bangle on left wrist. Thin brass ring in helix of
each ear. Seventy thin brass rings (aland&#333;ti) with heavy brass
ornament (adikaya) in dilated lobe of each ear. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. In addition to glass bead necklets, a necklet with heavy
heart-shaped brass pendants. String round neck to ward off fever.</p>
<p>4. String necklet with five brass cylinders pendent; five brass
bangles on right wrist; six brass and two iron bangles on left
wrist.</p>
<p>Right hand, one copper and five brass rings on middle finger; one
iron and three brass rings on little finger.</p>
<p>Left hand, one copper and five brass rings on middle finger; three
brass and two copper rings on ring finger; one brass ring on little
finger.</p>
<p>5. Trouser button in helix of left ear.</p>
<p>6. Brass bead necklet with pendent brass ornament with legend
&ldquo;Best superior umbrella made in Japan, made for Fazalbhoy Peeroo
Mahomed, Bombay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Cheruman, at Calicut, had his hair long and unkempt, as he played
the drum at the temple. Another had the hair arranged in four matted
plaits, for the cure of disease in performance of a vow. A man who wore
a copper cylinder on his loin string, containing a brass strip with
mantrams (consecrated formul&aelig;) engraved on it, sold it to me for
a rupee with the assurance that it would protect me from devils.</p>
<p>Concerning the marriage ceremony of the Cherumans in Malabar, Mr.
Appadorai Iyer writes that &ldquo;the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister is the
chief performer. It is she who pays the bride&rsquo;s price, and
carries her off. The consent of the parents is required, and is
signified by an interchange of visits between the parents of the bride
and bridegroom. During these visits, rice-water (conji) is sipped.
Before tasting the conji, they drop a fanam (local coin) into the
vessel containing it, as a token of assent to the marriage. When the
wedding party sets out, a large congregation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>of
Cherumans follow, and at intervals indulge in stick play, the women
singing in chorus to encourage them &lsquo;Let us see, let us see the
stick play (vadi tallu), Oh! Cheruman.&rsquo; The men and women mingle
indiscriminately in the dance during the wedding ceremony. On the
return to the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut, the bride is expected to weep
loudly, and deplore her fate. On entering the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut,
she must tread on a pestle placed across the threshold.&rdquo; During
the dance, the women have been described as letting down their hair,
and dancing with a tolerable amount of rhythmic precision amid vigorous
drumming and singing. According to another account, the bridegroom
receives from his brother-in-law a kerchief, which the giver ties round
his waist, and a bangle which is placed on his arm. The bride receives
a pewter vessel from her brother. Next her cousin ties a kerchief round
the groom&rsquo;s forehead, and sticks a betel leaf in it. The bride is
then handed over to the bridegroom.</p>
<p>Of the puberty and marriage ceremonies of the Pulayas of Cochin, the
following detailed account is given by Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer.
&ldquo;When a Pulaya girl comes of age, she is located in a separate
hut. Five Vallons (headmen), and the castemen of the kara (settlement),
are invited to take part in the performance of the ceremony. A song,
called malapattu, is sung for an hour by a Parayan to the accompaniment
of drum and pipe. The Parayan gets a para of paddy, and his assistants
three annas each. As soon as this is over, seven cocoanuts are broken,
and the water thereof is poured over the head of the girl, and the
broken halves are distributed among the five Vallons and seven girls
who are also invited to be present. Some more water is also poured on
the girl&rsquo;s head at the time. She is lodged in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>temporary hut for seven days, during which food is
served to her at a distance. She is forbidden to go out and play with
her friends. On the morning of the seventh day, the Vallons of the kara
and the castemen are again invited. The latter bring with them some
rice, vegetables, and toddy, to defray the expenses of the feast. At
dawn, the mother of the girl gives oil to the seven Pulaya maidens, and
to her daughter for an oil-bath. They then go to a neighbouring tank
(pond) or stream to bathe, and return home. The girl is then neatly
dressed, and adorned in her best. Her face is painted yellow, and
marked with spots of various colours. She stands before a few Parayas,
who play on their flute and drum, to cast out the demons, if any, from
her body. The girl leaps with frantic movements, if she is possessed by
them. In that case, they transfer them to a tree close by driving a
nail into the trunk after due offerings. If she is not possessed, she
remains unmoved, and the Parayas bring the music to a close. The girl
is again bathed with her companions, who are all treated to a dinner.
The ceremony then comes to an end with a feast to the castemen. The
ceremony described is performed by the Valluva Pulayas in the southern
parts, near and around the suburbs of Cochin, but is unknown among
other sub-tribes elsewhere. The devil-driving by the Parayas is not
attended to. Nor is a temporary hut erected for the girl to be lodged
in. She is allowed to remain in a corner of the hut, but is not
permitted to touch others. She is bathed on the seventh day, and the
castemen, friends and relations, are invited to a feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage is prohibited among members of the same koottam
(family group). In the Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk, members of the same
village do not intermarry, for they believe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>that
their ancestors may have been the slaves of some local landlord, and,
as such, the descendants of the same parents. A young man may marry
among the relations of his father, but not among those of his mother.
In the Palghat t&#257;luk, the Kanakka Cherumas pride themselves on the
fact that they avoid girls within seven degrees of relationship. The
marriage customs vary according to the sub-division. In the southern
parts of the State, Pulaya girls are married before puberty, while in
other places, among the Kanakka Cherumas and other sub-tribes, they are
married both before and after puberty. In the former case, when a girl
has not been married before puberty, she is regarded as having become
polluted, and stigmatised as a woman whose age is known. Her parents
and uncles lose all claim upon her. They formally drive her out of the
hut, and proceed to purify it by sprinkling water mixed with cow-dung
both inside and outside, and also with sand. She is thus turned out of
caste. She was, in former times, handed over to the Vallon, who either
married her to his own son, or sold her to a slave master. If a girl is
too poor to be married before puberty, the castemen of the kara raise a
subscription, and marry her to one of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a young Pulayan wishes to marry, he applies to his
master, who is bound to defray the expenses. He gives seven
fanams<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1590src" href="#xd21e1590" name=
"xd21e1590src">36</a> to the bride&rsquo;s master, one fanam worth of
cloth to the bride-elect, and about ten fanams for the marriage feast.
In all, his expenses amount to ten rupees. The ceremony consists in
tying a ring attached to a thread round the neck of the bride. This is
provided by her parents. When he becomes tired of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>his
wife, he may dispose of her to any other person who will pay the
expenses incurred at the marriage. There are even now places where
husband and wife serve different masters, but more frequently they
serve the same master. The eldest male child belongs to the master of
the mother. The rest of the family remain with the mother while young,
but, being the property of the owner, revert to him when of an age to
be useful. She also follows them, in the event of her becoming a widow.
In some places, a man brings a woman to his master, and says that he
wishes to keep her as his wife. She receives her allowance of rice, but
may leave her husband as she likes, and is not particular in changing
one spouse for another. In other places, the marriage ceremonies of the
Era Cherumas are more formal. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party goes to the
bride&rsquo;s hut, and presents rice and betel leaf to the head of the
family, and asks for the bride. Consent is indicated by the
bride&rsquo;s brother placing some rice and cloth before the assembly,
and throwing rice on the headman of the caste, who is present. On the
appointed day, the bridegroom goes to the hut with two companions, and
presents the girl with cloth and twelve fanams. From that day he is
regarded as her husband, and cohabitation begins at once. But the bride
cannot accompany him until the ceremony called mangalam is performed.
The bridegroom&rsquo;s party goes in procession to the bride&rsquo;s
hut, where a feast awaits them. The man gives sweetmeats to the
girl&rsquo;s brother. The caste priest recites the family history of
the two persons, and the names of their masters and deities. They are
then seated before a lamp and a heap of rice in a pandal (booth). One
of the assembly gets up, and delivers a speech on the duties of married
life, touching on the evils of theft, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>cheating, adultery, and
so forth. Rice is thrown on the heads of the couple, and the man
prostrates himself at the feet of the elders. Next day, rice is again
thrown on their heads. Then the party assembled makes presents to the
pair, a part of which goes to the priest, and a part to the master of
the husband. Divorce is very easy, but the money paid must be returned
to the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Ooragam proverthy of the Trich&#363;r t&#257;luk, I
find that the marriage among the Pulayas of that locality and the
neighbouring villages is a rude form of sambandham (alliance), somewhat
similar to that which prevails among the N&#257;yars, whose slaves a
large majority of them are. The husband, if he may be so called, goes
to the woman&rsquo;s hut with his wages, to stay therein with her for
the night. They may serve under different masters. A somewhat similar
custom prevails among the Pula Cherumas of the Trich&#363;r t&#257;luk.
The connection is called Merungu Kooduka, which means to tame, or to
associate with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young man, who wishes to marry, goes to the parents of the
young woman, and asks their consent to associate with their daughter.
If they approve, he goes to her at night as often as he likes. The
woman seldom comes to the husband&rsquo;s hut to stay with him, except
with the permission of the thamar (landlord) on auspicious occasions.
They are at liberty to separate at their will and pleasure, and the
children born of the union belong to the mother&rsquo;s landlord. Among
the Kanakka Cherumas in the northern parts of the State, the following
marital relations are in force. When a young man chooses a girl, the
preliminary arrangements are made in her hut, in the presence of her
parents, relations, and the castemen of the village. The auspicious day
is fixed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>and a sum of five fanams is paid as the
bride&rsquo;s price. The members assembled are treated to a dinner. A
similar entertainment is held at the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut to the
bride&rsquo;s parents, uncles, and others who come to see the
bridegroom. On the morning of the day fixed for the wedding, the
bridegroom and his party go to the bride&rsquo;s hut, where they are
welcomed, and seated on mats in a small pandal put up in front of the
hut. A muri (piece of cloth), and two small mundus (cloths) are the
marriage presents to the bride. A vessel full of paddy (unhusked rice),
a lighted lamp, and a cocoanut are placed in a conspicuous place
therein. The bride is taken to the booth, and seated by the side of the
bridegroom. Before she enters it, she goes seven times round it, with
seven virgins before her. With prayers to their gods for blessings on
the couple, the t&#257;li (marriage badge) is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck. The bridegroom&rsquo;s sister completes the knot.
By a strange custom, the bride&rsquo;s mother does not approach the
bridegroom, lest it should cause a ceremonial pollution. The ceremony
is brought to a close with a feast to those assembled. Toddy is an
indispensable item of the feast. During the night, they amuse
themselves by dancing a kind of wild dance, in which both men and women
joyfully take part. After this, the bridegroom goes along to his own
hut, along with his wife and his party, where also they indulge in a
feast. After a week, two persons from the bride&rsquo;s hut come to
invite the married couple. The bride and bridegroom stay at the
bride&rsquo;s hut for a few days, and cannot return to his hut unless
an entertainment, called Vathal Choru, is given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marriage customs of the Valluva Pulayas in the southern
parts of the State, especially in the Cochin and Kanayann&#363;r
t&#257;luks, are more formal. The average <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>age of a young man for
marriage is between fifteen and twenty, while that of a girl is between
ten and twelve. Before a young Pulayan thinks of marriage, he has to
contract a formal and voluntary friendship with another young Pulayan
of the same age and locality. If he is not sociably inclined, his
father selects one for him from a Pulaya of the same or higher status,
but not of the same illam (family group). If the two parents agree
among themselves, they meet in the hut of either of them to solemnise
it. They fix a day for the ceremony, and invite their Vallon and the
castemen of the village. The guests are treated to a feast in the usual
Pulaya fashion. The chief guest and the host eat together from the same
dish. After the feast, the father of the boy, who has to obtain a
friend for his son, enquires of the Vallon and those assembled whether
he may be permitted to buy friendship by the payment of money. They
give their permission, and the boy&rsquo;s father gives the money to
the father of the selected friend. The two boys then clasp hands, and
they are never to quarrel. The new friend becomes from that time a
member of the boy&rsquo;s family. He comes in, and goes out of their
hut as he likes. There is no ceremony performed at it, or anything done
without consulting him. He is thus an inseparable factor in all
ceremonies, especially in marriages. I suspect that the friend has some
claims on a man&rsquo;s wife. The first observance in marriage consists
in seeing the girl. The bridegroom-elect, his friend, father and
maternal uncle, go to the bride&rsquo;s hut, to be satisfied with the
girl. If the wedding is not to take place at an early date, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s parents have to keep up the claim on the bride-elect
by sending presents to her guardians. The presents, which are generally
sweetmeats, are taken to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>her hut by the bridegroom and his
friends, who are well fed by the mother of the girl, and are given a
few necessaries when they take leave of her the next morning. The next
observance is the marriage <span class="corr" id="xd21e1609" title=
"Source: negociation">negotiation</span>, which consists in giving the
bride&rsquo;s price, and choosing an auspicious day in consultation
with the local astrologer (Kaniyan). On the evening previous to the
wedding, the friends and relations of the bridegroom are treated to a
feast in his hut. Next day at dawn, the bridegroom and his friend,
purified by a bath, and neatly dressed in a white cloth with a
handkerchief tied over it, and with a knife stuck in their girdles, go
to the hut of the bride-elect accompanied by his party, and are all
well received, and seated on mats spread on the floor. Over a mat
specially made by the bride&rsquo;s mother are placed three measures of
rice, some particles of gold, a brass plate, and a plank with a white
and red cover on it. The bridegroom, after going seven times round the
pandal, stands on the plank, and the bride soon follows making three
rounds, when four women hold a cloth canopy over her head, and seven
virgins go in front of her. The bride then stands by the side of the
bridegroom, and they face each other. Her guardian puts on the wedding
necklace a gold bead on a string. Music is played, and prayers are
offered up to the sun to bless the necklace which is tied round the
neck of the girl. The bridegroom&rsquo;s friend, standing behind,
tightens the knot already made. The religious part of the ceremony is
now over, and the bridegroom and bride are taken inside the hut, and
food is served to them on the same leaf. Next the guests are fed, and
then they begin the poli or subscription. A piece of silk, or any red
cloth, is spread on the floor, or a brass plate is placed before the
husband. The guests assembled put in a few annas, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>and take
leave of the chief host as they depart. The bride is soon taken to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s hut, and her parents visit her the next day, and get
a consideration in return. On the fourth day, the bridegroom and bride
bathe and worship the local deity, and, on the seventh day, they return
to the bride&rsquo;s hut, where the t&#257;li (marriage badge) is
formally removed from the neck of the girl, who is bedecked with brass
beads round her neck, rings on her ears, and armlets. The next morning,
the mother-in-law presents her son-in-law and his friend with a few
necessaries of life, and sends them home with her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the seventh month of pregnancy, the ceremony of puli
kuti, or tamarind juice drinking, is performed as among other castes.
This is also an occasion for casting out devils, if any, from the body.
The pregnant woman is brought back to the hut of her own family. The
devil-driver erects a tent-like structure, and covers it with plantain
bark and leaves of the cocoanut palm. The flower of an areca palm is
fixed at the apex. A cocoanut palm flower is cut out and covered with a
piece of cloth, the cut portion being exposed. The woman is seated in
front of the tent-like structure with the flower, which symbolises the
yet unborn child in the womb, in her lap. The water of a tender
cocoanut in spoons made of the leaf of the jack tree (<i>Artocarpus
integrifolia</i>) is poured over the cut end by the Vallon, guardian,
and brothers and sisters present. The devil-driver then breaks open the
flower, and, by looking at the fruits, predicts the sex of the child.
If there are fruits at the end nearest the stem, the child will live
and, if the number of fruits is even, there will be twins. There will
be deaths if any fruit is not well formed. The devil-driver repeats an
incantation, whereby he invokes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>the aid of Kali, who is believed
to be present in the tent. He fans the woman with the flower, and she
throws rice and a flower on it. He repeats another incantation, which
is a prayer to Kali to cast out the devil from her body. This magical
ceremony is called Garbha Bali (pregnancy offering). The structure,
with the offering, is taken up, and placed in a corner of the compound
reserved for gods. The devotee then goes through the remaining forms of
the ceremony. She pours into twenty-one leaf spoons placed in front of
the tent a mixture of cow&rsquo;s milk, water of the tender cocoanut,
flower, and turmeric powder. Then she walks round the tent seven times,
and sprinkles the mixture on it with a palm flower. Next she throws a
handful of rice and paddy, after revolving each handful round her head,
and then covers the offering with a piece of cloth. She now returns,
and her husband puts into her mouth seven globules of prepared
tamarind. The devil-driver rubs her body with <i>Phlomis</i> (<i>?</i>)
petals and paddy, and thereby finds out whether she is possessed or
not. If she is, the devil is driven out with the usual offerings. The
devil-driver gets for his services twelve measures and a half of paddy,
and two pieces of cloth. The husband should not, during this period,
get shaved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a young woman is about to give birth to a child, she is
lodged in a small hut near her dwelling, and is attended by her mother
and a few elderly women of the family. After the child is born, the
mother and the baby are bathed. The woman is purified by a bath on the
seventh day. The woman who has acted as midwife draws seven lines on
the ground at intervals of two feet from one another, and spreads over
them aloe leaves torn to shreds. Then, with burning sticks in the hand,
the mother with the baby goes seven times over the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>leaves
backwards and forwards, and is purified. For these seven days, the
father should not eat anything made of rice. He lives on toddy, fruits,
and other things. The mother remains with her baby in the hut for
sixteen days, when she is purified by a bath so as to be free from
pollution, after which she goes to the main hut. Her enangathi
(relation by marriage) sweeps the hut and compound, and sprinkles water
mixed with cow-dung on her body as she returns after the bath. In some
places, the bark of athi (<i>Ficus glomerata</i>) and ithi (<i>Ficus
Tsiela?</i>) is well beaten and bruised, and mixed with water. Some
milk is added to this mixture, which is sprinkled both inside and
outside the hut. Only after this do they think that the hut and
compound are purified. Among the Cherumas of Palghat, the pollution
lasts for ten days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ear-boring ceremony is performed during the sixth or
seventh year. The Vallon, who is invited, bores the ears with a sharp
needle. The wound is healed by applying cocoanut oil, and the hole is
gradually widened by inserting cork, a wooden plug, or a roll of palm
leaves. The castemen of the village are invited, and fed. The landlord
gives the parents of the girl three paras of paddy, and this, together
with what the guests bring, goes to defray the expenses of the
ceremony. After the meal they go, with drum-beating, to the house of
the landlord, and present him with a para of beaten rice, which is
distributed among his servants. The ear-borer receives eight edangazhis
of paddy, a cocoanut, a vessel of rice, and four annas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman found to be having intercourse with a Paraya is
outcasted. She becomes a convert to Christianity or Mahomedanism. If
the irregularity takes place within the caste, she is well thrashed,
and prevented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>from resorting to the bad practice. In certain
cases, when the illicit connection becomes public, the castemen meet
with their Vallon, and conduct a regular enquiry into the matter, and
pronounce a verdict upon the evidence. If a young woman becomes
pregnant before marriage, her lover, should he be a Pulaya, is
compelled to marry her, as otherwise she would be placed under a ban.
If both are married, the lover is well thrashed, and fined. The woman
is taken before a Thandan (Izhuva headman), who, after enquiry, gives
her the water of a tender cocoanut, which she is asked to drink, when
she is believed to be freed from the sin. Her husband may take her back
again as his wife, or she is at liberty to marry another. The Thandan
gets a few annas, betel leaves and areca nuts, and tobacco. Both the
woman&rsquo;s father and the lover are fined, and the fine is spent in
the purchase of toddy, which is indulged in by those present at the
time. In the northern parts of the State, there is a custom that a
young woman before marriage mates with one or two paramours with the
connivance of her parents. Eventually one of them marries her, but this
illicit union ceases at once on marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the death ceremonies among the Cherumas of South Malabar, I
gather that &ldquo;as soon as a Cheruman dies, his jenmi or landlord is
apprised of the fact, and is by ancient custom expected to send a field
spade, a white cloth, and some oil. The drummers of the community are
summoned to beat their drums in announcement of the sad event. This
drumming is known as parayadikka. The body is bathed in oil, and the
near relatives cover it over with white and red cloths, and take it to
the front yard. Then the relatives have a bath, after which the corpse
is removed to the burying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>ground, where a grave is dug. All
those who have come to the interment touch the body, which is lowered
into the grave after some of the red cloths have been removed. A mound
is raised over the grave, a stone placed at the head, another at the
feet, and a third in the centre. The funeral cort&egrave;ge, composed
only of males, then returns to the house, and each member takes a
purificatory bath. The red cloths are torn into narrow strips, and a
strip handed over as a sacred object to a relative of the deceased.
Meanwhile, each relative having on arrival paid a little money to the
house people, toddy is purchased, and served to the assembly. The
mourners in the house have to fast on the day of the death. Next
morning they have a bath, paddy is pounded, and gruel prepared for the
abstainers. An elder of the community, the Avak&#257;si, prepares a
little basket of green palm leaves. He takes this basket, and hangs it
on a tree in the southern part of the compound (grounds). The gruel is
brought out, and placed on a mortar in the same part of the compound.
Spoons are made out of jack (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) leaves,
and the elder serves out the gruel. Then the relatives, who have
gathered again, make little gifts of money and rice to the house
people. Vegetable curry and rice are prepared, and served to the
visitors. A quaint ceremony called ooroonulka is next gone through. A
measure of rice and a measure of paddy in husk are mixed, and divided
into two shares. Four quarter-anna pieces are placed on one heap, and
eight on the other. The former share is made over to the house people,
and from the latter the Avak&#257;si removes four of the coins, and
presents one to each of the four leading men present. These four men
must belong to the four several points of the compass. The remaining
copper is taken by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78"
name="pb78">78</a>]</span>elder. From his share of rice and paddy he
gives a little to be parched and pounded. This is given afterwards to
the inmates. The visitors partake of betel and disperse, being informed
that the Polla or post-obituary ceremony will come off on the
thirteenth day. On the forenoon of this day, the relatives again gather
at the mourning place. The inmates of the house bathe, and fish and
rice are brought for a meal. A little of the fish is roasted over a
fire, and each one present just nibbles at it. This is done to end
pollution. After this the fish may be freely eaten. Half a seer or a
measure of rice is boiled, reduced to a pulpy mass, and mixed with
turmeric powder. Parched rice and the powder that remains after the
rice has been pounded, a cocoanut and tender cocoanut, some turmeric
powder, plantain leaves, and the rice that was boiled and coloured with
turmeric, are then taken to the burial ground by the Avak&#257;si, a
singer known as a Kall&#257;di or Moonpatk&#257;ren, and one or two
close relatives of the departed. With the pulped rice the elder moulds
the form of a human being. At the head of the grave a little mound is
raised, cabalistic lines are drawn across it with turmeric, and boiled
rice powder and a plantain leaf placed over the lines. The cocoanut is
broken, and its kernel cut out in rings, each of which is put over the
effigy, which is then placed recumbent on the plantain leaf. Round the
mound, strings of jungle leaves are placed. Next the elder drives a
pole into the spot where the chest of the dead person would be, and it
is said that the pole must touch the chest. On one side of the pole the
tender cocoanut is cut and placed, and on the other a shell containing
some toddy. Then a little copper ring is tied on to the top of the
pole, oil from a shell is poured over the ring, and the water from the
tender cocoanut and toddy are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>in turn similarly poured. After this
mystic rite, the Kall&#257;di starts a mournful dirge in monotone, and
the other actors in the solemn ceremony join in the chorus. The chant
tells of the darkness and the nothingness that were before the creation
of the world, and unfolds a fanciful tale of how the world came to be
created. The chant has the weird refrain Oh! ho! Oh! ho. On its
conclusion, the effigy is left at the head of the grave, but the
Kall&#257;di takes away the pole with him. The performers bathe and
return to the house of mourning, where the Kall&#257;di gets into a
state of afflation. The spirit of the departed enters into him, and
speaks through him, telling the mourners that he is happy, and does not
want them to grieve over much for him. The Kall&#257;di then enters the
house, and, putting a heap of earth in the corner of the centre room,
digs the pole into it. A light is brought and placed there, as also
some toddy, a tender cocoanut, and parched rice. The spirit of the
deceased, speaking again through the Kall&#257;di, thanks his people
for their gifts, and beseeches them to think occasionally of him, and
make him periodical offerings. The assembly then indulge in a feed.
Rice and paddy are mixed together and divided into two portions, to one
of which eight quarter-annas, and to the other twelve quarter-annas are
added. The latter share falls to the Avak&#257;si, while from the
former the mixture and one quarter-anna go to the Kall&#257;di, and a
quarter-anna to each of the nearest relatives. The basket which had
been hung up earlier in the day is taken down and thrown away, and the
jenmi&rsquo;s spade is returned to him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1655src" href="#xd21e1655" name="xd21e1655src">37</a></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Logan that &ldquo;the Cherumans, like other
classes, observe death pollution. But, as they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>cannot
at certain seasons afford to be idle for fourteen days consecutively,
they resort to an artifice to obtain this end. They mix cow-dung and
paddy, and make it into a ball, and place the ball in an earthen pot,
the mouth of which they carefully close with clay. The pot is laid in a
corner of the hut, and, as long as it remains unopened, they remain
free from pollution, and can mix among their fellows. On a convenient
day they open the pot, and are instantly seized with pollution, which
continues for forty days. Otherwise fourteen days consecutive pollution
is all that is required. On the forty-first or fifteenth day, as the
case may be, rice is thrown to the ancestors, and a feast
follows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following account of the death ceremonies is given by Mr.
Anantha Krishna Iyer. &ldquo;When a Pulayan is dead, the castemen in
the neighbourhood are informed. An offering is made to the
Kodungall&#363;r Bhagavati, who is believed by the Pulayas to watch
over their welfare, and is regarded as their ancestral deity. Dead
bodies are generally buried. The relatives, one by one, bring a new
piece of cloth, with rice and paddy tied at its four corners, for
throwing over the corpse. The cloth is placed thereon, and they cry
aloud three times, beating their breasts, after which they retire. A
few Parayas are invited to beat drums, and play on their musical
instruments&mdash;a performance which is continued for an hour or two.
After this, a few bits of plantain leaves, with rice flour and paddy,
are placed near the corpse, to serve as food for the spirit of the
dead. The bier is carried to the graveyard by six bearers, three on
each side. The pit is dug, and the body covered with a piece of cloth.
After it has been lowered into it, the pit is filled in with earth.
Twenty-one small bits of leaves are placed over the grave, above the
spot where the mouth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81"
name="pb81">81</a>]</span>of the dead man is, with a double-branched
twig fixed to the centre, a cocoanut is cut open, and its water is
allowed to flow in the direction of the twig which represents the dead
man&rsquo;s mouth. Such of the members of the family as could not give
him kanji (rice gruel) or boiled rice before death, now give it to him.
The six coffin-bearers prostrate themselves before the corpse, three on
each side of the grave. The priest then puts on it a ripe and tender
cocoanut for the spirit of the dead man to eat and drink. Then all go
home, and indulge in toddy and aval (beaten rice). The priest gets
twelve measures of rice, the grave-diggers twelve annas, the Vallon two
annas, and the coffin-bearers each an anna. The son or nephew is the
chief mourner, who erects a mound of earth on the south side of the
hut, and uses it as a place of worship. For seven days, both morning
and evening, he prostrates himself before it, and sprinkles the water
of a tender cocoanut on it. On the eighth day, his relatives, friends,
the Vallon, and the devil-driver assemble together. The devil-driver
turns round and blows his conch, and finds out the position of the
ghost, whether it has taken up its abode in the mound, or is kept under
restraint by some deity. Should the latter be the case, the ceremony of
deliverance has to be performed, after which the spirit is set up as a
household deity. The chief mourner bathes early in the morning, and
offers a rice-ball (pinda bali) to the departed spirit. This he
continues for fifteen days. On the morning of the sixteenth day, the
members of the family bathe to free themselves from pollution, and
their enangan cleans the hut and the compound by sweeping and
sprinkling water mixed with cow-dung. He also sprinkles the members of
the family, as they return after the bath. The chief mourner gets
shaved, bathes, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>returns to the hut. Some boiled rice, paddy,
and pieces of cocoanut, are placed on a plantain leaf, and the chief
mourner, with the members of his family, calls on the spirit of the
dead to take them. Then they all bathe, and return home. The castemen,
who have assembled there by invitation, are sumptuously fed. The chief
mourner allows his hair to grow as a sign of mourning (diksha), and,
after the expiry of the year, a similar feast is given to the
castemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cherumans are said by Mr. Gopal Panikkar to &ldquo;worship
certain gods, who are represented by rude stone images. What few
ceremonies are in force amongst them are performed by priests selected
from their own ranks, and these priests are held in great veneration by
them. They kill cocks as offerings to these deities, who are
propitiated by the pouring on some stones placed near them of the fresh
blood that gushes from the necks of the birds.&rdquo; The Cherumans are
further said to worship particular sylvan gods, garden deities, and
field goddesses. In a note on cannibalism,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1670src" href="#xd21e1670" name="xd21e1670src">38</a> the writer
states that &ldquo;some sixteen years ago a Nair was murdered in
Malabar by some Cherumans. The body was mutilated, and, on my asking
the accused (who freely confessed their crime) why had this been done?
they answered &lsquo;Tinn&#257;l p&#257;pam t&#299;rum, <i>i.e.</i>, if
one eats, the sin will cease&rsquo;.&rdquo; It is a common belief among
various castes of Hindus that one may kill, provided it is done for
food, and this is expressed in the proverb Konnap&#257;vam
th&#299;nn&#257;l thirum, or the sin of killing is wiped away by
eating. The Cheruman reply probably referred only to the wreaking of
vengeance, and consequent satisfaction, which is often expressed by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>lower classes in the words pasi thirndadu, or
hunger is satisfied.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the Pulayas, Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer
writes as follows. &ldquo;The Pulayas are animists, but are slowly
coming on to the higher forms of worship. Their gods are Parakutty,
Karinkutty, Chathan, and the spirits of their ancestors. Offerings to
these gods are given on Karkadaka and Makara Sankrantis, Onam, Vishu,
and other auspicious days, when one of the Pulayas present turns
Velichapad (oracle), and speaks to the assembly as if by inspiration.
They are also devout worshippers of Kali or Bhagavati, whose aid is
invoked in all times of danger and illness. They take part in the
village festivals celebrated in honour of her. Kodungallur Bhagavati is
their guardian deity. The deity is represented by an image or stone on
a raised piece of ground in the open air. Their priest is one of their
own castemen, and, at the beginning of the new year, he offers to the
goddess fowls, fruits, and toddy. The Pulayas also believe that spirits
exercise an influence over the members of their families, and therefore
regular offerings are given to them every year on Sankranti days. The
chief festivals in which the Pulayas take part are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>Pooram Vela.</i>&mdash;This, which may be described as the
Saturnalia of Malabar, is an important festival held at the village
Bhagavati temple. It is a festival, in which the members of all castes
below Br&#257;hmans take part. It takes place either in Kumbham
(February&ndash;March), or Meenam (March&ndash;April). The Cherumas of
the northern part, as well as the Pulayas of the southern parts of the
State, attend the festival after a sumptuous meal and toddy drinking,
and join the procession. Toy horses are made, and attached to long
bamboo poles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>which are carried to the neighbourhood of the
temple. As they go, they leap and dance to the accompaniment of pipe
and drum. One among them who acts as a Velichapad (devil-dancer) goes
in front of them, and, after a good deal of dancing and loud praying in
honour of the deity, they return home.</p>
<p>2. <i>Vittu Iduka.</i>&mdash;This festival consists in putting
seeds, or bringing paddy seeds to the temple of the village Bhagavati.
This also is an important festival, which is celebrated on the day of
Bharani, the second lunar day in Kumbham. Standing at a distance
assigned to them by the village authorities, where they offer prayers
to Kali, they put the paddy grains, which they have brought, on a
bamboo mat spread in front of them, after which they return home. In
the Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk, there is a festival called Kathiru,
celebrated in honour of the village goddess in the month of Vrischikam
(November-December), when these people start from the farms of their
masters, and go in procession, accompanied with the music of pipe and
drum. A special feature of the Kathiru festival is the presence, at the
temple of the village goddess, of a large number of dome-like
structures made of bamboo and plantain stems, richly ornamented, and
hung with flowers, leaves, and ears of corn. These structures are
called sarakootams, and are fixed on a pair of parallel bamboo poles.
These agrestic serfs bear them in grand processions, starting from
their respective farms, with pipe and drum, shouting and dancing, and
with fireworks. Small globular packets of palmyra leaves, in which are
packed handfuls of paddy rolled up in straw, are also carried by them
in huge bunches, along with the sarakootams. These packets are called
kathirkootoos (collection of ears of corn), and are thrown among the
crowd of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>spectators all along the route of the procession,
and also on arrival at the temple. The spectators, young and old,
scramble to obtain as many of the packets as possible, and carry them
home. They are then hung in front of the houses, for it is believed
that their presence will help in promoting the prosperity of the family
until the festival comes round again next year. The greater the number
of these trophies obtained for a family by its members, the greater, it
is believed, will be the prosperity of the family. The festival is one
of the very few occasions on which Pulayas and other agrestic serfs,
who are supposed to impart, so to speak, a long distant atmospheric
pollution, are freely allowed to enter villages, and worship in the
village temples, which generally occupy central positions in the
villages. Processions carrying sarakootams and kathirkootoos start from
the several farms surrounding the village early enough to reach the
temple about dusk in the evening, when the scores of processions that
have made their way to the temple merge into one great concourse of
people. The sarakootams are arranged in beautiful rows in front of the
village goddess. The Cherumas dance, sing, and shout to their hearts
content. Bengal lights are lighted, and fireworks exhibited.
Kathirkootoos are thrown by dozens and scores from all sides of the
temple. The crowd then disperses. All night, the Pulayas and other
serfs, who have accompanied the procession to the temple, are, in the
majority of cases, fed by their respective masters at their houses, and
then all go back to the farms.</p>
<p>3. <i>Mandalam Vilakku.</i>&mdash;This is a forty-one days&rsquo;
festival in Bhagavati temples, extending from the first of Vrischikam
(November-December) to the tenth of Dhanu (December-January), during
which temples are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>brightly illuminated both inside and outside
at night. There is much music and drum-beating at night, and offerings
of cooked peas or Bengal gram, and cakes, are made to the goddess,
after which they are distributed among those present. The forty-first
day, on which the festival terminates, is one of great celebration,
when all castemen attend at the temple. The Cherumas, Malayars, and
Eravallars attend the festival in Chitt&#363;r. They also attend the
Konga Pata festival there. In rural parts of the State, a kind of
puppet show performance (olapava koothu) is acted by Kusavans (potters)
and Tamil Chettis, in honour of the village deity, to which they
contribute their share of subscription. They also attend the cock
festival of Cranganore, and offer sacrifices of fowls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on the religion of the Pulayas of Travancore,
I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Iyer. &ldquo;The Pulayas worship the
spirits of deceased ancestors, known as Ch&#257;vars. The M&#257;tan,
and the Anchu Tamprakkal, believed by the better informed section of
the caste to be the five P&#257;ndavas, are specially adored. The
Pulayas have no temples, but raise squares in the midst of groves,
where public worship is offered. Each Pulaya places three leaves near
each other, containing raw rice, beaten rice, and the puveri (flowers)
of the areca palm. He places a flower on each of these leaves, and
prays with joined hands. Ch&#257;vars are the spirits of infants, who
are believed to haunt the earth, harassed by a number of unsatisfied
cravings. This species of supernatural being is held in mingled respect
and terror by Pulayas, and worshipped once a year with diverse
offerings. Another class of deities is called T&#275;varatumpuran,
meaning gods whom high caste Hindus are in the habit of worshipping at
Parassalay; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>Pulayas are given certain special concessions on
festival days. Similar instances may be noted at Ochira, Kumaranallur,
and Nedumangad. At the last mentioned shrine, Mateer writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1706src" href="#xd21e1706" name=
"xd21e1706src">39</a> &lsquo;where two or three thousand people, mostly
Sudras and Izhuvas, attend for the annual festival in March, one-third
of the whole are Parayas, Kuravas, V&#275;dars, Kanikkars, and Pulayas,
who come from all parts around. They bring with them wooden models of
cows, neatly hung over, and covered, in imitation of shaggy hair, with
ears of rice. Many of these images are brought, each in a separate
procession from its own place. The headmen are finely dressed with
cloths stained purple at the edge. The image is borne on a bamboo
frame, accompanied by a drum, and men and women in procession, the
latter wearing quantities of beads, such as several strings of red,
then several of white, or strings of beads, and then a row of brass
ornaments like rupees, and all uttering the Kurava cry. These images
are carried round the temple, and all amuse themselves for the
day.&rsquo; By far the most curious of the religious festivals of the
Pulayas is what is known as the Pula Saturday in Makaram
(January-February) at Sastamkotta in the Kunnattur t&#257;luk. It is an
old observance, and is most religiously gone through by the Pulayas
every year. The Valluvan, or caste priest, leads the assembled group to
the vicinity of the banyan tree in front of the temple, and offerings
of a diverse nature, such as paddy, roots, plantain fruits, game,
pulse, coins, and golden threads are most devoutly made. Pulayas
assemble for this ceremony from comparatively distant places. A deity,
who is believed to be the most important object of worship among the
Pulayas, is Utaya <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span>Tampuran, by which name they designate the
rising sun. Exorcism and spirit-dancing are deeply believed in, and
credited with great remedial virtues. The Kokkara, or iron rattle, is
an instrument that is freely used to drive out evil spirits. The
Valluvan who offers animal sacrifices becomes immediately afterwards
possessed, and any enquiries may be put to him without it being at all
difficult for him to furnish a ready answer. In North Travancore, the
Pulayas have certain consecrated buildings of their own, such as
Kamancheri, Omkara Bhagavathi, Yakshi Ampalam, Pey Koil, and
Valiyapattu Muttan, wherein the Valluvan performs the functions of
priesthood. The Pulayas believe in omens. To see another Pulaya, to
encounter a Native Christian, to see an Izhuva with a vessel in the
hand, a cow behind, a boat containing rice or paddy sacks, etc., are
regarded as good omens. On the other hand, to be crossed by a cat, to
see a fight between animals, to be encountered by a person with a
bundle of clothes, to meet people carrying steel instruments, etc., are
looked upon as very bad omens. The lizard is not believed to be a
prophet, as it is by members of the higher castes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the caste government of the Pulayas of Travancore, Mr.
Subramania Iyer writes as follows. &ldquo;The Ayikkara Yajamanan, or
Ayikkara Tamara (king) is the head of the Pulaya community. He lives at
Vayalar in the Shertalley t&#257;luk in North Travancore, and takes
natural pride in a lace cap, said to have been presented to one of his
ancestors by the great Cheraman Perum&#257;l. Even the Parayas of North
Travancore look upon him as their legitimate lord. Under the Tamara are
two nominal headmen, known as Tatteri Achchan and Mannat Koil Vallon.
It is the Ayikkara Tamara who appoints the Valluvans, or local priests,
for every kara, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>for which they are obliged to remunerate him with
a present of 336 chuckrams. The Pulayas still keep accounts in the
earliest Travancorean coins (chuckrams). The Valluvan always takes care
to obtain a written authority from the Tamara, before he begins his
functions. For every marriage, a sum of 49 chuckrams and four
mulikkas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1715src" href="#xd21e1715" name=
"xd21e1715src">40</a> have to be given to the Tamara, and eight
chuckrams and one mulikka to the Valluvan. The Valluvan receives the
Tamara&rsquo;s dues, and sends them to Vayalar once or twice a year.
Beyond the power of appointing Valluvans and other office-bearers, the
authority of the Tamara extends but little. The Valluvans appointed by
him prefer to call themselves Head Valluvans, as opposed to the
dignitaries appointed in ancient times by temple authorities and other
Br&#257;hmans, and have a general supervising power over the Pulayas of
the territory that falls under their jurisdiction. Every Valluvan
possesses five privileges, viz., (1) the long umbrella, or an umbrella
with a long bamboo handle; (2) the five-coloured umbrella; (3) the
bracelet of honour; (4) a long gold ear-ring; (5) a box for keeping
betel leaves. They are also permitted to sit on stools, to make use of
carpets, and to employ kettle-drums at marriage ceremonials. The staff
of the Valluvan consists of (1) the Kuruppan or accountant, who assists
the Valluvan in the discharge of his duties; (2) the Komarattan or
exorciser; (3) the Kaikkaran or village representative; (4) the
Vatikkaran, constable or sergeant. The Kuruppan has diverse functions
to perform, such as holding umbrellas, and cutting cocoanuts from
trees, on ceremonial occasions. The Vatikkaran is of special importance
at the bath that succeeds a Pulaya girl&rsquo;s first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>menses.
Adultery is looked upon as the most heinous of offences, and used to be
met with condign punishment in times of old. The woman was required to
thrust her hand into a vessel of boiling oil, and the man was compelled
to pay a fine of 336 or 64 chuckrams, according as the woman with whom
he connected himself was married or not, and was cast out of society
after a most cruel rite called Ariyum Pirayum Tittukka, the precise
nature of which does not appear to be known. A married woman is tried
by the Valluvan and other officers, when she shows disobedience to her
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer, that, &ldquo;in the Palghat
t&#257;luk of South Malabar, it is said that the Cherumas in former
times used to hold grand meetings for cases of theft, adultery,
divorce, etc., at Kannati Kutti Vattal. These assemblies consisted of
the members of their caste in localities between Valayar forests and
Karimpuzha (in Valluvan&#257;d t&#257;luk), and in those between the
northern and southern hills. It is also said that their deliberations
used to last for several days together. In the event of anybody
committing a crime, the punishment inflicted on him was a fine of a few
rupees, or sometimes a sound thrashing. To prove his innocence, a man
had to swear &lsquo;By Kannati Swarupam (assembly) I have not done
it.&rsquo; It was held so sacred that no Cheruman who had committed a
crime would swear falsely by this assembly. As time went on, they found
it difficult to meet, and so left off assembling together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the amusements of the Pulayas, Mr. Anantha
Krishna Iyer writes that &ldquo;their games appear to be connected in
some way with their religious observances. Their favourite dance is the
kole kali, or club dance. A party of ten or twelve men, provided with
sticks, each a yard in length, stand in a circle, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>move
round, striking at the sticks, keeping time with their feet, and
singing at the same time. The circle is alternately widened and
narrowed. Vatta kali is another wild dance. This also requires a party
of ten or twelve men, and sometimes young women join them. The party
move in a circle, clapping their hands while they sing a kind of rude
song. In thattinmel kali, four wooden poles are firmly stuck in the
ground, two of which are connected by two horizontal pieces of wood,
over which planks are arranged. A party of Pulayas dance on the top of
this, to the music of their pipe and drum. This is generally erected in
front of the Bhagavati temple, and the dancing takes place immediately
after the harvest. This is intended to propitiate the goddess. Women
perform a circular dance on the occasions of marriage
celebrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cherumas and Pulayas are, like the Koragas of South Canara,
short of stature, and dark-skinned. The most important measurements of
the Cherumans whom I investigated at Calicut were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Cheruppu-katti</b> (shoemaker).&mdash;Said to be a Malay&#257;lam
synonym for M&#257;diga.</p>
<p><b>Chetti.</b>&mdash;It is noted in the Census Report, 1891, that
&ldquo;the name Chetti is used both to denote a distinct caste, and
also a title, and people bearing this title describe themselves loosely
as belonging to the Chetti caste, in the same way as a Vell&#257;la
will say that he is a Mudali. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>This use of Chetti has caused some
confusion in the returns, for the sub-divisions show that many other
castes have been included as well as Chetti proper.&rdquo; Again, in
the Census Report, 1901, it is recorded that &ldquo;Chetti means
trader, and is one of those titular or occupational terms, which are
often loosely employed as caste names. The weavers, oil pressers, and
others use it as a title, and many more tack it on to their names, to
denote that trade is their occupation. Strictly employed, it is
nevertheless, the name of a true caste.&rdquo; The Chettis are so
numerous, and so widely distributed, that their many sub-divisions
differ very greatly in their ways. The best known of them are the
B&#275;ri Chettis, the Nagarattu Chettis, the K&#257;sukkar Chettis,
and the N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis. Of these, the B&#275;ri and
N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis are dealt with in special articles. The
following divisions of Chettis, inhabiting the Madura district, are
recorded in my notes:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Men with head clean-shaved:&mdash;
<ul>
<li>Ilavagai or Karnakudi.</li>
<li>Sundaraththan.</li>
<li>Ariy&#363;r.</li>
<li>Malampatti.</li>
<li>P&#257;layapattu.</li>
<li>Thedak&#333;ttai.</li>
<li>Periyak&#333;ttai-vell&#257;n.</li>
<li>Puliyangudi.</li>
<li>Vallam or Tiruvapp&#363;r.</li>
<li>Kurungal&#363;r.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Men with kudumi (hair knot):&mdash;
<ul>
<li>Puvaththukudi or Mannagudi.</li>
<li>Kiramangalam.</li>
<li>Vallan&#257;ttu.</li>
<li>M&#257;rayakk&#257;ra.</li>
<li>Pandukudi or Manjapaththu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the Puvaththukudi Chettis, who receive their name from a
village in the Tanjore district, are mostly itinerant petty traders and
money-lenders, who travel about the country. They carry on their
shoulders a bag containing their personal effects, except when they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>are cooking and sleeping. I am informed that the
Puvaththukudi women engage women, presumably with a flow of appropriate
language ready for the occasion, to abuse those with whom they have a
quarrel. Among the Puvaththukudi Chettis, marriages are, for reasons of
economy, only celebrated at intervals of many years. Concerning this
custom, a member of the community writes to me as follows. &ldquo;In
our village, marriages are performed only once in ten or fifteen years.
My own marriage was celebrated in the year Nandana (1892&ndash;93).
Then seventy or eighty marriages took place. Since that time, marriages
have only taken place in the present year (1906). The god at Avadaiyar
k&#333;vil (temple) is our caste god. For marriages, we must receive
from that temple garlands, sandal, and palanquins. We pay to the temple
thirty-five rupees for every bridegroom through our Nagaraththar
(village headmen). The expenses incurred in connection with the
employment of washermen, barbers, n&#257;gasaram (musical instrument)
players, talay&#257;ris (watchmen), carpenters, potters, blacksmiths,
gurukkals (priests), and garland-makers, are borne collectively and
shared by the families in which marriages are to take place.&rdquo;
Another Chetti writes that this system of clubbing marriages together
is practised at the villages of Puvaththukudi and Mannagudi, and that
the marriages of all girls of about seven years of age and upwards are
celebrated. The marriages are performed in batches, and the marriage
season lasts over several months.</p>
<p>Palayasengadam in the Trichinopoly district is the head-quarters of
a section of the Chettis called the Pannirend&#257;m (twelfth) Chettis.
&ldquo;These are supposed to be descended from eleven youths who
escaped long ago from K&#257;v&#275;ripatnam, a ruined city in Tanjore.
A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>Ch&#333;la king, says the legend, wanted to marry
a Chetti; whereupon the caste set fire to the town, and only these
eleven boys escaped. They rested on the Ratnagiri hill to divide their
property; but however they arranged it, it always divided itself into
twelve shares instead of eleven. The god of Ratnagiri then appeared,
and asked them to give him one share in exchange for a part of his car.
They did so, and they now call themselves the twelfth Chettis from the
number of the shares, and at their marriages they carry the bridegroom
round in a car. They are said to be common in Coimbatore
district.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1826src" href="#xd21e1826"
name="xd21e1826src">41</a></p>
<p>At the census, 1871, some of the less fortunate traders returned
themselves as &ldquo;bankrupt Chettis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following castes and tribes are recorded as having assumed the
title Chetti, or its equivalent Setti:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Balija. Telugu trading caste.</li>
<li>Bant. Tulu cultivating caste.</li>
<li>Bilimagga, D&#275;v&#257;nga, Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran, S&#257;liyan,

<p>Of proverbs relating to Chettis,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1893src"
href="#xd21e1893" name="xd21e1893src">42</a> the following may be

"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>a
regular table of numerals. Numbers one to ten have been given definite
names, and they have been so long in use that most of them do not
understand the meaning of the terms they use. Thus madi (mind) stands
for one, mind being always represented in the Hindu shastras as a
single thing. Ven&#275; (act or deed) stands for two, for ven&#275; is
of two kinds only, nalven&#275; and thiven&#275; or good and bad acts.
Konam (quality) stands for three, since three different sorts of
qualities are recognised in Hindu metaphysics. These are r&#257;jasam,
th&#257;masam, and s&#257;thm&#299;kam. Shuruthi stands for four, for
the Srutis or V&#275;das are four in numbers. Sara (arrow) stands for
five, after Panchasara, the five-arrowed, a well-known name of
Manmatha, the Indian Cupid. Matha represents six, after the shan
mathams or six systems of Hindu philosophy. Th&#275;r&#275; stands for
seven, after the seven oceans recognised by the Sanskrit geographers.
Giri (mountain) represents eight, since it stands for ashtagiri or the
eight mountains of the Hindus. Mani stands for nine, after navamani,
the nine different sorts of precious stones recognised by the Hindus.
Thisai represents ten, from the ten points of the compass. The common
name for rupee is vell&#275; or the white thing. Thang&#257;m
vell&#275; stands for half a rupee, pinji vell&#275; for a quarter of a
rupee, and p&#363; vell&#275; for an eighth of a rupee. A fanam (or
1&frac14; annas) is known as shulai. The principal objects with which
those who use this language have to deal with are padi or measure,
vell&#275; or rupee, and madi an&#257;, one anna, so that madi padi
means one measure, madi vell&#275; one rupee, and madi an&#257; one
anna. Similarly with the rest of the numerals. The merchants of
Trichinopoly have nearly the same table of numerals, but the names for
the fractions of a rupee vary considerably. M&#363;ndri an&#257; is,
with them, one anna; &#275; an&#257; is two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>annas;
p&#363; an&#257; is four annas; pani an&#257; is eight annas and
m&#363;na an&#257; is twelve annas. Among them also vell&#275; stands
for a rupee. They have besides another table of numerals in use, which
is curious as being formed by certain letters of the Tamil alphabet.
Thus p&#299;na stands for one, l&#257;na for two, laina for three,
y&#257;na for four, l&#299;na for five, m&#257;na for six, v&#257;na
for seven, n&#257;na for eight, th&#299;na for nine, and thuna for ten.
These letters have been strung into the mnemonic phrase Pillayalam
Vanthathu, which literally means &lsquo;the children have come&rsquo;.
This table is also used in connection with measures, rupees, and annas.
Dealers in coarse country-made cloths all over Madras and the
Chingleput district have a table of their own. It is a very complete
one from one pie to a thousand rupees. Occasionally Hindu merchants are
found using a secret language based on Hindustani. This is the case in
one part of Madras city. With them p&#257;v kh&#257;n&#275; stands for
one anna, ada kh&#257;n&#275; for <span class="corr" id="xd21e1922"
title="Source: fwo">two</span> annas, p&#257;vak rupp&#275; for one
rupee, and so on. Brokers have terms of their own. The Tamil phrase
padiya par, when used by them, means ask less or say less, according as
it is addressed to the purchaser or seller. Similarly, mudukka par
means ask a higher price. When a broker says Sivan th&#257;mbram, it is
to be inferred that the price given out by the seller includes his own
brokerage. Telugu brokers have similar terms. Among them, the phrase
Malasu vakk&#257;du and N&#257;si vakk&#257;du denote respectively
increase the rate, and decrease the rate stated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Chinese-Tamil Cross.</b>&mdash;Halting in the course of an
anthropological expedition on the western side of the N&#299;lgiri
plateau, I came across a small settlement of Chinese, who have squatted
for some time on the slopes of the hills between Naduvatam and
Gudal&#363;r and developed, as the result of alliances with Tamil
Pariah women, into a colony, earning a modest livelihood by cultivating
vegetables and coffee.</p>
<p>The original Chinese who arrived on the N&#299;lgiris were convicts
from the Straits Settlement, where there was no sufficient prison
accommodation, who were confined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99"
href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>in the N&#299;lgiri jail. It is
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1992src" href="#xd21e1992" name=
"xd21e1992src">44</a> that, in 1868, twelve of the Chinamen
&ldquo;broke out during a very stormy night, and parties of armed
police were sent out to scour the hills for them. They were at last
arrested in Malabar a fortnight later. Some police weapons were found
in their possession, and one of the parties of police had
disappeared&mdash;an ominous circumstance. Search was made all over the
country for the party, and at length their four bodies were found lying
in the jungle at Walagh&#257;t, half way down the Sisp&#257;ra
gh&#257;t path, neatly laid out in a row with their severed heads
carefully placed on their shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father was a typical Chinaman, whose only grievance was that, in
the process of conversion to Christianity, he had been obliged to
&ldquo;cut him tail off.&rdquo; The mother was a typical dark-skinned
Tamil Paraiyan. The colour of the children was more closely allied to
the yellowish tint of the father than to that of the mother; and the
semi-Mongol parentage was betrayed in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>slant eyes, flat nose
and (in one case) conspicuously prominent cheek-bones.</p>
<p>To have recorded the entire series of measurements of the children
would have been useless for the purpose of comparison with those of the
parents, and I selected from my repertoire the length and breadth of
the head and nose, which plainly indicate the paternal influence on the
external anatomy of the offspring. The figures given in the table bring
out very clearly the great breadth, as compared with the length, of the
heads of all the children, and the resultant high cephalic index. In
other words, in one case a mesaticephalic (79), and, in the remaining
three cases, a sub-brachycephalic head (80.1; 80.1; 82.4) has resulted
from the union of a mesaticephalic Chinaman (78.5) with a
sub-dolichocephalic Tamil Paraiyan (76.8). How great is the breadth of
the head in the children may be emphasised by noting that the average
head-breadth of the adult Tamil Paraiyan man is only 13.7 cm., whereas
that of the three boys, aged ten, nine, and five only, was 14.3, 14,
and 13.7 cm. respectively.</p>
<p>Quite as strongly marked is the effect of paternal influence on the
character of the nose; the nasal index, in the case of each child
(68.1; 71.772; 7; 68.3), bearing a much closer relation to that of the
long-nosed father (71.7) than to the typical Paraiyan nasal index of
the broad-nosed mother (78.7).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to note hereafter what is the future of the
younger members of this quaint little colony, and to observe the
physical characters, temperament, fecundity, and other points relating
to the cross breed resulting from the blend of Chinese and Tamil.</p>
<p><b>Chinna</b> (little).&mdash;A sub-division of B&#333;ya, Kunnuvan,
Konda Dora, Pattanavan, and Pattapu, and an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>exogamous sept of M&#257;la. Chinna, chinnam,
and chinnada, denoting gold, occur as exogamous septs of Kuruba, Padma
S&#257;l&#275;, Toreya, and Vakkaliga.</p>
<p><b>Chintala</b> (tamarind: <i>Tamarindus Indica</i>).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of Gh&#257;si, Golla, M&#257;diga, and M&#257;la.
Chintyakula, or tamarind sept, occurs among the K&#333;matis;
chintaginjala (tamarind seeds) as an exogamous sept of Padma
S&#257;l&#275;s, and of Panta Reddis, who may not touch or use the
seeds; and Chintakai or Chintakayala (tamarind fruit) as an exogamous
sept of B&#333;yas and Dev&#257;ngas.</p>
<p><b>Chirla</b> (woman&rsquo;s cloth).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Kamma.</p>
<p><b>Chitikan.</b>&mdash;A synonym of M&#257;r&#257;n, indicating one
whose occupation relates to the funeral pyre. A Chitikan, for example,
performs the funeral rites for the M&#363;ssads.</p>
<p><b>Chiti Karnam.</b>&mdash;A name of the Oriya Karnam caste. A
vulgar form of Sresta Karnam (Sreshto Korono).</p>
<p><b>Chitra Gh&#257;si.</b>&mdash;The Chitra Gh&#257;sis, for the
following note on whom I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao, are a
class of artisans, whose name, meaning Gh&#257;sis who make artistic
things, bears reference to their occupation. They are employed in the
manufacture of brass and bell-metal jewelry, such as is largely worn by
the tribes inhabiting the Jeypore Agency tracts, and are generally
found attached to Kond and Savara villages. They are a polluting class,
and their dwellings are consequently situated at some distance from the
huts of the villagers. Their language is a corrupt form of Oriya.</p>
<p>Girls are usually married after puberty. A man can claim his
paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. When such a marriage is
contemplated, his parents take a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>little rice and a pot of
liquor to the home of the paternal aunt. If they are accepted, it is
taken as a sign that the match is agreed to, and the jholla tonka
(bride-price) of twelve rupees is paid. After some time has elapsed,
the bride is conducted to the home of her future husband, and the
marriage is there celebrated. A younger brother may marry the widow of
an elder brother, and, if such a woman contracts a marriage with some
other man, her second husband has to give a cow to the younger brother
who has been passed over. The dead are burnt, and death pollution is
observed for three days, during which the caste occupation is not
carried on. On the third day, the ashes are collected together, and a
fowl is killed. The ashes are then buried, or thrown into running
water.</p>
<p><b>Chitrak&#257;ra or Chitrak&#257;ro.</b>&mdash;The
Chitrak&#257;ros of Ganjam, who are a class of Oriya painters (chitra,
painting), are returned in the Census Report, 1901, as a sub-caste of
Muchi. In the Mysore Census Report, 1891, the Chitrag&#257;ras are said
to be &ldquo;also called Bannag&#257;ra of the R&#257;chevar (or
R&#257;ju) caste. They are painters, decorators and gilders, and make
trunks, palanquins, &lsquo;lacquer&rsquo; toys and wooden images for
temples, cars, etc.&rdquo; At Channapatna in Mysore, I interviewed a
Telugu Chitrak&#257;ra, who was making toys out of the white wood of
<i>Wrightia tinctoria</i>. The wood was turned on a primitive lathe,
consisting of two steel spikes fixed into two logs of wood on the
ground. Seated on the floor in front of his lathe, the artisan chucked
the wood between the spikes, and rotated it by means of a bow held in
the right hand, whereof the string was passed round the wood. The
chisel was held between the sole of the right foot and palm of the left
hand. Colours and varnish were applied to the rotating toy with sticks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>of paint like sealing-wax, and strips of palm
leaf smeared with varnish. In addition to the turned toys, models of
fruits were made from mud and sawdust, cane cradles made by
M&#275;daras were painted and idols manufactured for the Holi festival
at Bangalore, and the figure of Sidi V&#299;ranna for the local
pseudo-hook-swinging ceremony. The Chitrak&#257;ras, whom I saw at
Tumk&#363;r, had given up making toys, as it did not pay. They
manufacture big wooden idols (gr&#257;ma d&#275;vata), <i>e.g.</i>,
Ellamma and M&#257;riamma, and vehicles for various deities in the
shape of bulls, snakes, peacocks, lions, tigers, and horses. They
further make painted figures of Lakshmi, and heads of Gauri, the wife
of Siva, decorated with gold-leaf jewels, which are worshipped by
Br&#257;hmans, Vakkaligas, K&#333;matis, and others at the annual Gauri
p&#363;ja; and mandah&#257;sa (god houses) with pillars carved with
figures of Narasimha and conventional designs. These mandah&#257;sas
serve as a receptacle for the household gods (s&#257;lagr&#257;ma
stone, lingam, etc.), which are worshipped daily by Smarta and
M&#257;dhva Br&#257;hmans. These Chitrak&#257;ras claimed to be
Suryavamsam, or of the lunar race of Kshatriyas, and wear the sacred
thread.</p>
<p><b>Chitravaliar.</b>&mdash;A synonym of Alavan.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#333;gan.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Izhava.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#333;lapuram or Sh&#333;lavaram.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of
Chetti.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#333;liya Pattar.</b>&mdash;A name for Pattar Br&#257;hmans in
Malabar.</p>
<p><b>Chondi.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Sondi.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#333;utag&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;A corrupt form of
Chapt&#275;g&#257;ra.</p>
<p><b>Ch&#333;vatton.</b>&mdash;Priests of M&#363;ttans and
Tarakans.</p>
<p><b>Chuditiya.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Kevuto.</p>
<p><b>Chunam</b> (lime).&mdash;A sub-division of Toreyas, who are
manufacturers of lime. Chunam, made from calcined <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>shells, limestone, etc., is largely used for
building purposes, and the chunam plaster of Madras has been long
celebrated for its marble-like polish. Chunam is also chewed with
betel.</p>
<p><b>Chuvano.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as a small Oriya cultivating caste, supposed to be of Kshatriya
parentage.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>D&#257;indla.</b>&mdash;The name, denoting those
who hid or ran away, of a sub-division of M&#257;la.</p>
<p><b>Daivampati.</b>&mdash;Recorded in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, as a caste included among Ambalav&#257;sis, and a sub-division of
N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Dakkala.</b>&mdash;Dakkala or Dakkali is the name of a class of
mendicants who beg from M&#257;digas only. In the Kurnool district they
are said to have divided the district with the Mushtis, and not to beg
except within their own limits.</p>
<p>The following story is told as regards the origin of the Dakkalas. A
smith was asked to make a bottu (marriage badge) for Siva&rsquo;s
wedding, and for this purpose required bellows, fire-pot, hammer, etc.
J&#257;mbuvadu called his eldest son, and prepared the various
implements from sundry parts of the body, except the backbone. Being
highly pleased at this, the gods endowed the backbone with life, and
the son went to his father J&#257;mbuvadu, who failed to recognise him,
and refused to admit him. He was told that he must live as a beggar
attached to the M&#257;digas, and was called Dakkala because he was
brought to life from a vertebral column (dakka).</p>
<p>The Dakkalas wander from place to place. They may not enter
M&#257;diga houses, outside which meals are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>given to them by males only, as females are not
allowed to serve them. M&#257;diga women may not tread on the footsteps
of the Dakkalas.</p>
<p><b>Dakku</b> (fear).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#257;la.</p>
<p><b>Dakni.</b>&mdash;Dakni or Deccani is defined in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a territorial name meaning a Musalman of the
Deccan; also a name loosely applied to converts to Islam.&rdquo; In the
Tanjore district, Muhammadans who speak Hindustani, and claim pure
Muhammadan descent, are spoken of as Daknis or Dakanis. In other Tamil
districts they are called Pat&#257;nigal, to distinguish them from
Labbais and Marakk&#257;yars. The Daknis follow the Muhammadan ritual
except in their marriages, which afford an example of a blend between
Hindu and Muhammadan ceremonials. Like Hindus, they erect, at times of
marriage, a milk-post of bamboo, to which are tied a two-anna piece,
and a bit of sugar-candy done up in a Turkey red cloth. The post is
handed to the headman, who decorates it with a garland of flowers and a
roll of betel, and places it in a hole made in the court-yard of the
house, wherein milk has been sprinkled. On the following day, two big
pots are placed near the milk-post, and filled with water by four
married couples. Around the pots, nine kinds of seed grains are
sprinkled. On the third day, the bridegroom&rsquo;s party proceeds to
the house of the bride with thirteen trays of betel, fruits, flowers,
sandal paste, and a paste made of turmeric and henna (<i>Lawsonia
alba</i>) leaves. The bride is decorated, and sits on a plank. Women
smear the face and hands of the bridal couple with the pastes, and one
of them, or the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, ties a string of black beads
round the bride&rsquo;s neck. While this is being done, no one should
sneeze. Wrist threads (kankanam) are tied on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>wrists of the bride and bridegroom. On the
fourth day, the nikka rite is celebrated, and the newly-married couple
sit together while the nalagu ceremony of smearing them with sandal,
and waving coloured water (&#257;rati), is performed. The two pots
containing water are kept for forty days, and then examined. If the
water remains sweet, and does not &ldquo;teem with vermin,&rdquo; it is
regarded as a good omen. The seed grains, too, should by this time have
developed into healthy seedlings.</p>
<p><b>Dammula.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as a small class of Telugu beggars, and priests in the temples of
village goddesses.</p>
<p><b>Dand&#257;si.</b>&mdash;The Dand&#257;sis are summed up in the
Ganjam Manual as being village watchmen, many of whom are great
thieves. &ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; Mr. S. P. Rice writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2265src" href="#xd21e2265" name="xd21e2265src">1</a>
&ldquo;to find that the word Naiko [meaning leader or chief], which is
corrupted into the Telugu Naidu, is the caste distinction of the lowest
class, the village watcher and professional thief. This man, for all
that his cognomen is so lofty, goes by the generic name of
Dand&#257;si. This word means worthy of punishment, and assuredly no
appellation ever fitted its owner more completely than does this. He is
the village policeman and the village thief, a curious mixture of
callings.&rdquo; According to other versions, the name is derived from
danda, a stick, and &#257;si, sword, from dandab&#257;di, a stout
bamboo stick, or from dandap&#257;si, stick and rope, in reference to
the insignia of the Dand&#257;si&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>A large number of criminals, undergoing punishment in Ganjam for
robbery and thieving, are Dand&#257;sis. The members of the caste, like
the Tamil Kallans, believe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>that thieving is their traditional
occupation, and, as such, regard it as justifiable. There is a legend
that they adopted this occupation as their profession because their
ancestors assisted the P&#257;ndavas to escape from the lac fort which
was constructed by the Kurus with a view to killing them, by digging a
secret subterranean passage. According to another story, the
Dand&#257;sis are descended from the offspring of a clandestine amour
of Krishna with Dh&#363;uthika, R&#257;dha&rsquo;s handmaid. The
Dand&#257;sis perform an interesting ceremony of initiation into the
profession of thieving, when a child is born. When it is three or five
days old, the headman (B&#275;hara) is invited to attend. A breach is
made in the wall, or beneath the door sill. Through this the infant is
passed by the B&#275;hara three times, and received by some members of
the family. Each time the B&#275;hara repeats the words &ldquo;Enter,
baby enter. May you excel your father!&rdquo; The Dand&#257;sis, when
questioned concerning this custom, denied its existence, but some
admitted that it was carried out in former days. An old woman stated
that her grandchild was passed through a breach beneath the door, but
was not inclined to enter into details.</p>
<p>A number of exogamous septs occur among the Dand&#257;sis, of which
the following may be noted. Members of the Santar&#257;si sept must
avoid using mats made of the sedge which goes by this name. Kilalendias
avoid touching the bamboo posts used by washermen to support the ropes
on which cloths are hung to dry. They sacrifice a pig and seven fowls
to their gods on the new-moon day, on which the head of a male child is
first shaved. Diy&#257;sis show special reverence for the sun, and
cloths, mokkutos (forehead chaplets), garlands, and other articles to
be used by the bride and bridegroom at a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>wedding, are placed
outside the house, so that they may be exposed to it. Members of the
Ekopothiriya sept are regarded as low in the social scale, and the
following legend is narrated to account for this. A Dand&#257;si went,
with his relations and friends, to the house of a Dand&#257;si of the
Ekopothiriya sept, to arrange a marriage. The guests were hospitably
received, and the prospective bride asked her father what kind of curry
was going to be served to them. He replied that barikolora (backyard
<i>Momordica</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2280src" href="#xd21e2280"
name="xd21e2280src">2</a> was to be cooked. This aroused the curiosity
of some of the guests, who went to the backyard, where, instead of
<i>Momordica</i>, they saw several blood-suckers (lizards) running
about. They jumped to the conclusion that these were what the host
referred to as barikolora, and all the guests took their departure.
Ekopothiriyas will not partake of food from the same plate as their
grown-up children, even if a married daughter comes on a visit to
them.</p>
<p>The Dand&#257;sis worship various T&#257;kur&#257;nis (village
deities), <i>e.g.</i>, Sankaithuni, Kulladankuni, Komb&#275;sari and
K&#257;limuki. The gods are either represented temporarily by brass
vessels, or permanently by three masses of clay, into each of which a
small bit of gold is thrust. When <i>Bassia</i> (mahu&#257;) buds or
mangoes are first eaten in their season, a sacrifice is made, and a
goat and fowl are killed before the produce of the harvest is first
partaken of.</p>
<p>The Dand&#257;sis have a headman, called B&#275;hara, who exercises
authority over several groups of villages, and each group is under a
N&#257;yako, who is assisted by a Dondia. For every village there is a
Bholloboya, and, in some places, there is an officer, called Boda
Mundi, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>appointed by the Zamindar, to whom
irregularities in the community have to be reported. When a woman is
delivered of a still-born child, the whole family is under pollution
for eleven days. The headman is then invited to attend, and presents
are given to him. He sprinkles water over members of the family, and
they are thereby freed from this pollution.</p>
<p>A certain portion of the property stolen by Dand&#257;sis is set
apart for the headman, and, like the Tamil Kallans and Maravans, they
seem to have a blackmailing system. If a Dand&#257;si is engaged as a
watchman, property is safe, or, if stolen, is recovered and restored to
its owner.</p>
<p>Girls are married after puberty. A man may marry his maternal
uncle&rsquo;s, but not his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. The marriage
ceremonies usually last three days, but are sometimes spread over seven
days, in imitation of the higher castes. On the day (gondo sono) before
the wedding day, seven new pots are brought from a potter&rsquo;s
house, and placed in a room. Seven women throw <i>Zizyphus jujuba</i>
leaves over them, and they are filled with water at a tank (pond). One
of the pots must be carried by the sister-in-law of the bridegroom. A
brass vessel is tied up, and worshipped. Towards evening, a fowl is
sacrificed at an &lsquo;ant&rsquo; hill. The bridegroom is shaved on
this day by his sister&rsquo;s husband. Like other Oriya castes, the
Dand&#257;sis collect water at seven houses, but only from those of
members of castes higher than their own. The pot containing this water
is hung up over the marriage dais (bedi). On the wedding (bibha) day,
the bridegroom sits on the dais, with the bride, seated in her maternal
uncle&rsquo;s lap or at his side, in front of him. The headman, or some
respected elder of the community, places a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>betel nut cutter, on, or with some rice and
betel nut between the united hands of the contracting couple, and ties
them together with seven turns of a turmeric-dyed thread. He then
announces that ... the granddaughter of ... and daughter of ... is
united to ... the grandson of ... and son of ... The parents of the
bride and bridegroom pour turmeric-water from a chank (<i>Turbinella
rapa</i>) shell or leaf over their united hands. The nut-cutter is
removed by the bride&rsquo;s brother, and, after striking the
bridegroom, he goes away. The couple then play with cowry
(<i>Cypr&aelig; arabica</i>) shells, and, while they are so engaged,
the ends of their cloths are tied together, and the rice which is in
their hands is tied in a knot. When the play is finished, this knot is
untied, and the rice is measured in a small earthen pot, first on
behalf of the bride, and is pronounced to be all right. It is then
again measured, and said to have diminished in quantity. This gives
rise to jokes at the expense of the bridegroom, who is called a thief,
and other hard names. Those who imitate the ceremonial of the higher
castes make the bridegroom go away in feigned anger, after he has
broken the pot which is hanging over the dais. He is brought back by
his brother-in-law.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the first menstrual period, a girl is under
pollution for seven days. If she is engaged to be married, her future
father-in-law makes her a present of jewels and money on the seventh
day, and thereby confirms the marriage contract.</p>
<p>The dead are cremated. A widow accompanies the corpse of her husband
to the boundary of the village, carrying a ladle and pot, which she
throws down at the boundary, and returns home. On the day after the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>funeral, the embers are extinguished, and an
effigy of the deceased is made on the spot where he was cremated, and
food offered to it. Toddy is distributed among those who have assembled
at the house. On the tenth day, food is offered on ten fragments of
pots. On the eleventh day, if the dead man was an important personage
in the community, a ceremony, corresponding to the jola jola handi of
the higher castes, is performed. A cloth is spread on the ground, on
the spot where the corpse was cremated, and the ground round it swept
by women, whose backs are turned towards the cloth, so that they cannot
see it. Two men, with swords or big knives, sit by the side of the
cloth and wait till an insect settles on the cloth. They then at once
put the swords or knives on the cloth, and, folding it up, place it on
a new winnowing-basket. It is taken home, placed on the floor, and
connected by means of a long thread with the household god (mass of
clay or vessel). It is then shaken near the god, so that the insect
falls out.</p>
<p>Dand&#257;si further occurs as a sub-division of the Kondras, the
members of which have taken to the profession of village watchmen.</p>
<p><b>Dandi</b> (a staff).&mdash;A house name of Korava.</p>
<p><b>Dandu</b> (army).&mdash;A sub-division of &#298;diga, and an
exogamous sept of B&#333;ya and K&#257;pu. It has been suggested that
the name is not Dandu but Dand&#275;, meaning pole, in reference to the
apparatus used by the &#298;digas in climbing palm trees for the
extraction of toddy. Dandu Agasa, indicating army washerman, occurs as
a name for some Mar&#257;tha Dh&#333;bis in Mysore, whose forefathers
probably accompanied armies in times of war.</p>
<p><b>D&#257;ra</b> (stream of water).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
M&#257;la. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Darabala.</b>&mdash;Taken, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as
a sub-caste of M&#257;la. It is a common house-name among many Telugu
castes.</p>
<p><b>D&#257;r&#257;la</b> (thread).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
M&#257;diga.</p>
<p><b>Darzi.</b>&mdash;Darzi or Darj&#299; is a Muhammadan occupational
term, meaning tailor. &ldquo;The east,&rdquo; it has been
said,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2350src" href="#xd21e2350" name=
"xd21e2350src">3</a> &ldquo;now sews by machinery. The name of Singer
is known from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. In every bazaar in
India one may see men&mdash;they are always men, not women&mdash;in
turban or Mussalman cap, crouching over the needle-plate, and working
the pedals.&rdquo; The value of the imports of sewing-machines rose, in
British India, from Rs. 5,91,046 in 1901&ndash;02 to Rs. 10,06,625 in
1904&ndash;05.</p>
<p><b>D&#257;s.</b>&mdash;The title of Jain immigrants from Northern
India, most of whom are established as merchants, and also of the
Mahants of the Tirumala (Tirupati) temple, <i>e.g.</i>, Balar&#257;m
D&#257;s, Bhagav&#257;n D&#257;s.</p>
<p><b>Dasari.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;Dasari or T&#257;dan,&rdquo; Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2364src" href="#xd21e2364"
name="xd21e2364src">4</a> &ldquo;is a mendicant caste of Vaishnavas,
the reputed descendants of a wealthy S&#363;dra of one of the northern
districts, who, being devoid of offspring, vowed that, should he be
blessed with children, he would devote one to the service of his god.
He subsequently had many sons, one of whom he named D&#257;san
(servant), and placed entirely at the service of the deity. D&#257;san
forfeited all claim to participate in his father&rsquo;s estate, and
his offspring are therefore all beggars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caste, like that of the S&#257;t&#257;nis, is reinforced
by idle members of the lower S&#363;dra classes, who, being branded by
the gurus of Tirupati and other shrines, become D&#257;saris thereby.
They usually wander about, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>singing hymns to a monotonous
accompaniment upon a leather instrument called tappai (tabret). Some
S&#363;dra castes engage them thus to chant in front of the corpse at
funerals, and many, accompanying bands of pilgrims travelling to
Tirupati, stimulate their religious excitement by singing sacred songs.
A few, called Yerud&#257;ndis, (<i>q.v.</i>), take possession of young
bulls that have been devoted to a sw&#257;mi, and teach them to perform
tricks very cleverly. The bulls appear to understand what is said to
them, and go through various antics at the word of command. Some
D&#257;saris exhibit what is called the Panda S&#275;rvai performance,
which consists in affecting to be possessed by the spirit of the deity,
and beating themselves all over the body with a flaming torch, after
covering it probably with some protecting substance. In such modes do
they wander about and receive alms, each wearing as a distinction a
garland of beads made of tulasi (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>) wood. Every
D&#257;sari is a Tengalai. They have six sub-divisions, called Balija,
Janappa, Palli, Valluva, Gangeddula, and Golla D&#257;saris, which
neither eat together nor intermarry. As these are the names of existing
and distinct castes, it is probable that the D&#257;saris were formerly
members of those classes, who, through their vagabond tastes, have
taken to a mendicant life. Beyond prohibiting widow remarriage, they
have no social restrictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the mendicants of Anantapur, Mr. W. Francis
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2379src" href="#xd21e2379" name=
"xd21e2379src">5</a> that &ldquo;the beggars who are most in evidence
are the D&#257;saris. This community is recruited from several castes,
such as the K&#257;pus, Balijas, Kurubas, B&#333;yas, and M&#257;las,
and members of it who belong to the last two of these (which are low in
the social scale) are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>not allowed to dine with the
others. All D&#257;saris are Vaishnavites, and admission to the
community is obtained by being branded by some Vaishnavite guru.
Thenceforward the novice becomes a D&#257;sari, and lives by begging
from door to door. The profession is almost hereditary in some
families. The five insignia of a D&#257;sari are the conch shell, which
he blows to announce his arrival; the gong which he strikes as he goes
his rounds; the tall iron lamp (with a cocoanut to hold the oil for
replenishing it) which he keeps lighted as he begs; the brass or copper
vessel (sometimes with the n&#257;mam painted on it) suspended from his
shoulder, in which he places the alms received; and the small metal
image of Hanum&#257;n, which he hangs round his neck. Of these, the
iron lamp is at once the most conspicuous and the most indispensable.
It is said to represent Venkat&#275;sa, and it must be burning, as an
unlighted lamp is inauspicious. D&#257;saris also subsist by doing
p&#363;ja (worship) at ceremonial and festival occasions for certain of
the Hindu castes.&rdquo; In the Kurnool district, when a girl is
dedicated as a Basavi (dedicated prostitute), she is not, as in some
other parts of the country, married to an idol, but tied by means of a
garland of flowers to the tall standard lamp (garudakambham) of a
D&#257;sari, and released by the man who is to receive her first
favours, or by her maternal uncle.</p>
<p>The D&#257;saris in Mysore are described in the Mysore Census
Report, 1901, as &ldquo;mendicants belonging to different classes of
S&#363;dras. They become D&#257;sas or servants dedicated to the God at
Tirupati by virtue of a peculiar vow, made either by themselves or
their relatives, at some moment of anxiety or danger, and live by
begging in His name. D&#257;saris are always Vaishnavites, as the vows
are taken only by those castes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>which are worshippers of that
deity. D&#257;saris are invited by S&#363;dras on ceremonial days, and
feasted. Properly speaking, D&#257;sari is not a caste, but simply an
occupational division. Among certain castes, the custom of taking a vow
to become a D&#257;sari prevails. In fulfilment of that vow the person
becomes a D&#257;sari, and his eldest son is bound to follow suit, the
others taking to other walks of life. The following castes take the vow
of becoming D&#257;sari:&mdash;Telugu Banajiga, Holeya, Tigala, and
Vakkaliga. The duty of a D&#257;sari requires that he should daily
bathe his head, and take care that, while eating with the profane,
their victuals do not get mixed with his. Every Saturday, after bathing
and praying for some hours, he must cook his own food in a clean pot.
They go about the streets singing some Hari Keerthanams, with a gong
and conch to relieve the dull monotony of their mumblings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the synonym T&#257;dan, this is stated<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2390src" href="#xd21e2390" name="xd21e2390src">6</a> to be
&ldquo;a corruption of the Sanskrit d&#257;sa which, with the Tamil
termination an, stands for d&#257;san. The word is often used in this
form, but often as D&#257;sari. The word is applied to Vaishnava
mendicants. They go out every morning, begging for alms of uncooked
rice, and singing ballads or hymns. They play on a small drum with
their fingers, and often carry a conch shell, which they blow. They are
given to drinking.&rdquo; In the Nellore Manual, the D&#257;srivandlu
are summed up as being &ldquo;mendicants and thieves in the Telugu and
Canarese countries. They usually practise what is known as
scissor-theft.<span class="corr" id="xd21e2393" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> The mendicant D&#257;saris, who are
dealt with in the present note, are stated by Mr. S. M. Natesa
Sastri<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2396src" href="#xd21e2396" name=
"xd21e2396src">7</a> to be called Gudi D&#257;sari, as the gudi or
temple is their home <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>and to be a set of quiet, innocent and
simple people, leading a most idle and stupid life. &ldquo;Quite
opposed,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;to the Gudi D&#257;saris in every way
are the Donga D&#257;saris or thieving D&#257;saris. They are the most
dreaded of the criminal classes in the Bellary district. These Donga
D&#257;saris are only D&#257;saris in name.&rdquo; (<i>See</i> Donga
D&#257;sari.)</p>
<p>Some D&#257;saris are servants under Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans, who
act as gurus to various castes. It is their duty to act as messengers
to the guru, and carry the news of his arrival to his disciples. At the
time of worship, and when the guru approaches a village, the
D&#257;sari has to blow a long brass trumpet (t&#257;rai). As the
Br&#257;hman may not approach or touch his Paraiyan disciples, it is
the D&#257;sari who gives them the holy water (thirtham). When a
Paraiyan is to be branded, the Br&#257;hman heats the instruments
bearing the devices of the chank and chakaram, and hands them to the
D&#257;sari, who performs the operation of branding. For councils,
settlement of marriage, and the decision of other social matters, the
D&#257;saris meet, at times of festivals, at well-known places such as
Tirutani, Tirupati or Tiruvall&#363;r.</p>
<p>At the annual festival at the temple at K&#257;ramadi in the
Coimbatore district, which is visited by very large numbers, belonging
for the most part to the lower orders, various vows are fulfilled.
These include the giving of kavalam to D&#257;saris. Kavalam consists
of plantain fruits cut up into small slices, and mixed with sugar,
jaggery (crude sugar), fried grain, or beaten rice. The D&#257;saris
are attached to the temple, and wear short drawers, with strings of
small brass bells tied to their wrists and ankles. They appear to be
possessed, and move wildly about to the beating of drums. As they go
about, the devotee <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>puts some of the kavalam into their mouths.
The D&#257;saris eat a little, and spit out the remainder into the
hands of the devotees, who eat it. This is believed to cure all
diseases, and to give children to those who partake of it. In addition
to kavalam, some put betel leaves into the mouths of the D&#257;saris,
who, after chewing them, spit them into the mouths of the devotees. At
night the D&#257;saris carry large torches made of rags, on which the
devotees pour gh&#299; (clarified butter). Some say that, many years
ago, barren women used to take a vow to visit the temple at the
festival time, and, after offering kavalam, have sexual intercourse
with the D&#257;saris. The temple authorities, however, profess
ignorance of this practice.</p>

<p>When proceeding on a pilgrimage to the temple of Subramanya
Sw&#257;mi at Palni, some devotees pierce their cheeks with a long
silver skewer, which traverses the mouth cavity; pierce the tongue with
a silver arrow, which is protruded vertically through the protruded
organ; and place a silver shield (mouth-lock) in front of the mouth.
Some D&#257;saris have permanent holes in their cheeks, into which they
insert skewers when they go about the country in pursuit of their
profession.</p>
<p>For the following note on D&#257;saris in the Vizagapatam district,
I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The caste is an endogamous
unit, the members calling themselves Sankhu (or conch-blowing)
D&#257;saris, and is divided into numerous exogamous septs. The
m&#275;narikam custom, according to which a man should marry his
maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is followed. The remarriage of widows
is permitted, but divorce is forbidden. The dead are cremated, and the
chinna (small) and pedda r&#333;zu (big day) death ceremonies are
observed. These D&#257;saris profess the Tengalai form of Vaishnavism,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>get themselves branded. The caste is more
secular, and less religious than in the southern districts. A
D&#257;sari of the North Arcot or Anantapur type, with conch-shell,
metal gong, iron lamp, copper vessel, and metal image of Hanum&#257;n
on his neck, is scarcely met with. The Vizagapatam D&#257;saris are the
most popular among ballad-singers, and sing songs about heroes and
heroines, of which the following are the most appreciated:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Bobbilip&#257;ta, which describes the siege and conquest of
Bobbili by Bussy in 1757.</p>
<p>2. Ammi N&#257;yudup&#257;ta, which describes the tyrannical
behaviour of one Ammi N&#257;yudu, a village headman in the
P&#257;lkonda t&#257;luk, who was eventually murdered, to the great
relief of those subject to him, by one of his dependents.</p>
<p>3. Lakshmammap&#257;ta, which relates the life and death of
Lakshmamma, a Velama woman, who went against the m&#275;narikam custom
of the caste, and was put to death by her husband.</p>
<p>4. Yerakammap&#275;rant&#257;la-p&#257;ta, which recounts the story
of one Yerakamma, who committed sati.</p>
<p>Yerakamma is the local goddess at Srungavarapuk&#333;ta in the
Vizagapatam district. The ballads sung about her say that she was the
child of D&#257;sari parents, and that her birth was foretold by a
Yerukala woman (whence her name), who prophesied that she would have
the gift of second sight. She eventually married, and one day she
begged her husband not to go to his field, as she was sure he would be
killed by a tiger if he did. Her husband went notwithstanding, and was
slain as she had foreseen. She committed sati on the spot where her
shrine still stands, and at this there is a festival at Sivar&#257;tri.

<p>As ballad-singers, two D&#257;saris generally travel about together,
begging from house to house, or at the weekly market, one singing,
while the other plays, and joins in the chorus.</p>
<p>The titles of these D&#257;saris are Anna and Ayya.</p>
<p>D&#257;sari has been recorded as an exogamous sept of the Koravas,
M&#257;las, and Yerukalas.</p>
<p><b>D&#257;si</b> (servant).&mdash;The name for a non-Br&#257;hman
female attendant upon a Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hman woman, which should
not, as sometimes happens, be confused with D&#275;va-d&#257;si,
(<i>q.v.</i>), which has quite another significance.</p>
<p><b>D&#257;yar&#275;</b> (Muhammadan).&mdash;The D&#257;yar&#275;,
Daira, or M&#257;had&#275;v Muhammadans are found in the Bangalore and
Mysore districts of the Mysore province. Concerning them, we are
informed in the Mysore Gazetteer that &ldquo;they differ from the
general body of Muhammadans in a point of belief concerning the advent
of Im&#257;m Mahadi. The D&#257;yar&#275;s maintain that he has visited
this earth and departed, while the orthodox Muhammadans believe the
Prophet (Im&#257;m) has not yet appeared, and that his coming will be a
sign of the end of the world. The following account of the origin of
this body of dissenters has been related. A child was born of the Sayad
sect of Muhammadans at Guzrat about four hundred years ago, who was
named Sayad Ahmed, and afterwards became distinguished by the title of
Alam (superior to Maulvi) in consequence of his great learning. Sayad
Ahmed proclaimed himself the equal of Mahomet, and superior to all
other Paigambars or messengers of god. He succeeded in obtaining some
followers who believed in him, and repaired to Jivanpur in the
Nizam&rsquo;s territories, where he took the name of Im&#257;m Mahadi.
From thence he, with some disciples, proceeded to Mecca, but did not
visit Medina. After some time he returned to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>Hyderabad, still retaining the name of Im&#257;m
Mahadi. Such pretensions could not be tolerated by the great mass of
Muhammadans, and Sayad Ahmed, together with his disciples, being
worsted in a great religious controversy, was driven out of Hyderabad,
and came to Channapatna in the Bangalore district, where they settled.
The descendants of these settlers believe that Sayad Ahmed was the
Prophet Im&#257;m Mahadi predicted in the Kor&#257;n. They offer
prayers in a masjid of their own, separate from other Muhammadans, and
do not intermarry with the rest. They are an enterprising body, and
carry on a brisk trade in silk with the western coast.&rdquo; They are
mostly domiciled at Channapatna, where a considerable industry in the
cocoons of the mulberry silk-moth is carried on.</p>
<p>When an adult Hindu joins the D&#257;yar&#275;s as a convert, an
interesting mock rite of circumcision is performed as a substitute for
the real operation. A strip of betel leaf is wrapped round the penis,
so that it projects beyond the glans, and is snipped instead of the
prepuce.</p>
<p>Like other Muhammadan classes of Southern India, the
D&#257;yar&#275;s are as a whole dolichocephalic. But the frequent
occurrence of individuals with a high cephalic index would seem to
point to their recruitment from the mesaticephalic or brachycephalic
Canarese classes.</p>

denoting ruler of a country, is a name assumed by some Janappans, who
say that they are Balijas.</p>
<p><b>D&#275;s&#257;yi.</b>&mdash;For the following account of the
D&#275;s&#257;yi institution, I am indebted to an excellent account
thereof by Mr. S. M. Natesa Sastri.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2534src"
href="#xd21e2534" name="xd21e2534src">8</a> &ldquo;The word
D&#275;s&#257;yi means of the country. For almost every t&#257;luk in
the North Arcot district there is a headman, called the
D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti, who may be said in a manner to correspond to a
Justice of the Peace. The headmen belong to the Kavarai or Balija
caste, their family name being Dhanap&#257;la&mdash;a common name among
the Kavarais&mdash;which may be interpreted as &lsquo;the protector of
wealth.&rsquo; The Dhanap&#257;la D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti holds sway
over eighteen castes, Kavarai, Uppara, Lamb&#257;di, J&#333;gi,
&#298;diga, Paraiyan, etc. All those that are called valangai, or
right-hand caste, fall within his jurisdiction. He has an establishment
of two peons (orderlies), who are castemen, and another menial, a sort
of bugler, who blows the horn whenever the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti goes
on circuit. When any deviation in the moral conduct of any man or woman
occurs in a village under the D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s jurisdiction, a
report of it is at once sent to the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti, through
the Paraiya of the village, by the D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s
representative in that village. He has his local agent in every village
within his jurisdiction. On receipt of a report, he starts on circuit
to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>village, with all the quaint-looking
paraphernalia attached to his office. He moves about from place to
place in his bullock coach, the inside of which is upholstered with a
soft cushion bed, with a profusion of pillows on all sides. The Paraiya
horn-blower runs in front of the carriage blowing the horn (bhamka),
which he carries suspended from his shoulder when it is not in use. On
the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti arriving at a village, the horn is blown to
announce his visit on professional matters. While he camps at a
village, people from the surrounding country within his jurisdiction
usually go to him with any representations they may have to make to him
as the head of their caste. The D&#275;s&#257;yi generally encamps in a
tope (grove) adjoining the village. At the sound of the horn, the
castemen on whose account the visit is made assemble at the place of
encampment, with the D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s local representative at
their head. The personal comforts of the D&#275;s&#257;yi are first
attended to, and he is liberally supplied with articles of food by the
party on whose account the visit has been undertaken. A large
cup-shaped spoon is the ensign of the D&#275;s&#257;yi. On the outer
surface, all round its edge, are carved in relief eighteen figures,
each one being typical of one of the castes of which the
D&#275;s&#257;yi is the social head. Under each figure is inscribed in
Tamil the name of the caste which that figure typifies. The figures are
smeared with red powder and sandal, and decorated with flowers. The
menial, taking up the cup, rings the bell attached to it, to summon the
parties. As soon as the sound is heard, the castemen amongst whom any
offence has occurred assemble, each house in the village being
represented by a member, so as to make up a panch&#257;yat (council).
The D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s emblem is then placed in front of him in
the midst of the panch&#257;yat, and a regular enquiry held. Supposing
a person stands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>charged with adultery, the accused is
brought before the assembly, and the charge formally investigated with
the advice of the panch&#257;yat, the D&#275;s&#257;yi declares the
accused guilty or not guilty, as the case may be. In the event of a man
being pronounced guilty, the panch&#257;yat directs him to pay the
aggrieved husband all the expenses he had incurred in connection with
his marriage. In addition to this, a fine ranging from ten to twenty
rupees is imposed on the offender by the D&#275;s&#257;yi, and is
collected at once. A small fraction of this fine, never exceeding four
annas, is paid to every representative who sits in the panch&#257;yat,
the balance going into the D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s pocket. If the
delinquent refuses to pay the fine, a council of the same men is held,
and he is excommunicated. The recalcitrant offender soon realises the
horrors of excommunication, and in a short time appears before the
D&#275;s&#257;yi, and falls prostrate at his feet, promising to obey
him. The D&#275;s&#257;yi then accompanies him to the village, calls
the panch&#257;yat again, and in their presence removes the interdict.
On this occasion, the excommunicated person has to pay double the
amount of the original fine. But disobedience is rare, as people are
alive to the serious consequences of excommunication. The
D&#275;s&#257;yi maintains a regular record of all his enquiries and
judgments, and in the days of the Naw&#257;bs these decisions were, it
would appear, recognised by the Courts of Justice. The same respect
was, it is said, also shown to the D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s decisions
by the early courts of John Company.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>&ldquo;Every house belonging to the eighteen castes sends to the
village representative of the D&#275;s&#257;yi, who is called
Periyatanak&#257;ran, a pagoda (Rs. 3&ndash;8) in cash, besides
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>rice, dh&#257;l (<i>Cajanus Indicus</i>), and
other articles of food for every marriage that takes place, in the
village. The representative reserves for himself all the perishable
articles, sending only the cash to the D&#275;s&#257;yi. Thus, for
every marriage within his jurisdiction, the D&#275;s&#257;yi gets one
pagoda. Of late, in the case of those D&#275;s&#257;yis who have
purchased their rights as such from the old D&#275;s&#257;yis, instead
of a pagoda, a fee of two annas and a half is levied on each marriage.
Every death which occurs in a village is equally a source of income to
the D&#275;s&#257;yi, who receives articles of food, and four annas or
more, according to the circumstances of the parties in whose house the
death has occurred. As in the case of marriage, the local
representative appropriates to himself the articles of food, and
transmits the money to the D&#275;s&#257;yi. The local agent keeps a
list of all domestic occurrences that take place in the village, and
this list is most carefully scrutinised and checked by the
D&#275;s&#257;yi during his tours, and any amount left unpaid is then
collected. Whenever a marriage takes place in his own house, all the
houses within his jurisdiction are bound to send him rice, dh&#257;l,
and other articles, and any money they can afford to pay. Sometimes
rich people send large sums to the D&#275;s&#257;yi, to enable him to
purchase the clothes, jewels, etc., required for the marriage. When a
D&#275;s&#257;yi finds his work too heavy for him to attend to
single-handed, he sells a portion of his jurisdiction for some hundreds
or thousands of rupees, according to its extent, to some relation. A
regular sale deed is executed and registered.&rdquo; (<i>See</i> also
Samaya.)</p>
<p><b>D&#275;sikar.</b>&mdash;A sub-division and title of

<p><b>D&#275;s&#363;r.</b>&mdash;The name of a sub-division of
K&#257;pu, which is either territorial, or possibly derived from

<p><b>D&#275;va.</b>&mdash;D&#275;va or D&#275;vara, meaning God, has
been recorded as a synonym of D&#275;v&#257;nga and G&#257;niga or
G&#257;ndla and a sept of Mog&#275;r, and D&#275;va Telikulakali as a
name for those who express and sell oils in the Vizagapatam district.
D&#275;vara occurs further as a title of the Jangams. At the Madras
Census, 1901, D&#275;var was returned as the name of Telugu merchants
from Pondicherry trading in glassware. D&#275;var is also the title of
&#332;cchans, who are priests at temples of village deities. The title
of Maravans is D&#275;van or T&#275;van. In South Canara, the Halepaiks
(toddy-drawers) are known as D&#275;varu Makkalu (God&rsquo;s
children), which, it has been suggested,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2573src" href="#xd21e2573" name="xd21e2573src">10</a> is possibly
a corruption of T&#299;varu or D&#299;varu Makkalu, meaning children of
the islanders, in reference to their supposed descent from early
immigrants from the island of Ceylon.</p>
<p><b>D&#275;va-d&#257;si.</b>&mdash;In old Hindu works, seven classes
of D&#257;sis are mentioned, viz., (1) Datt&#257;, or one who gives
herself as a gift to a temple; (2) Vikr&#299;ta, or one who sells
herself for the same purpose; (3) Bhritya, or one who offers herself as
a temple servant for the prosperity of her family; (4) Bhakta, or one
who joins a temple out of devotion; (5) Hrita, or one who is enticed
away, and presented to a temple; (6) Alank&#257;ra, or one who, being
well trained in her profession, and profusely decked, is presented to a
temple by kings and noblemen; (7) Rudraganika or Gopika, who receive
regular wages from a temple, and are employed to sing and dance. For
the following general account I am indebted to the Madras Census
Report, 1901:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&#257;sis or D&#275;va-d&#257;sis (handmaidens of the gods)
are dancing-girls attached to the Tamil temples, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>subsist by dancing and music, and the practice
of &lsquo;the oldest profession in the world.&rsquo; The D&#257;sis
were probably in the beginning the result of left-handed unions between
members of two different castes, but they are now partly recruited by
admissions, and even purchases, from other classes. The profession is
not now held in the consideration it once enjoyed. Formerly they
enjoyed a considerable social position. It is one of the many
inconsistencies of the Hindu religion that, though their profession is
repeatedly and vehemently condemned by the Sh&#257;stras, it has always
received the countenance of the church. The rise of the caste, and its
euphemistic name, seem both of them to date from about the ninth and
tenth centuries A.D., during which much activity prevailed in Southern
India in the matter of building temples, and elaborating the services
held in them. The dancing-girls&rsquo; duties, then as now, were to fan
the idol with chamaras (Tibetan ox tails), to carry the sacred light
called kumbarti, and to sing and dance before the god when he was
carried in procession. Inscriptions<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2584src"
href="#xd21e2584" name="xd21e2584src">11</a> show that, in A.D. 1004,
the great temple of the Ch&#333;la king R&#257;jar&#257;ja at Tanjore
had attached to it four hundred talic&rsquo; ch&#275;ri pendugal, or
women of the temple, who lived in free quarters in the four streets
round about it, and were allowed tax-free land out of the endowment.
Other temples had similar arrangements. At the beginning of the last
century there were a hundred dancing-girls attached to the temple at
Conjeeveram, who were, Buchanan tells us,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2587src" href="#xd21e2587" name="xd21e2587src">12</a> &lsquo;kept
for the honour of the deities and the amusement of their votaries; and
any familiarity between these girls and an infidel would occasion
scandal.&rsquo; At Madura, Conjeeveram, and Tanjore there are still
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>numbers of them, who receive allowances from the
endowments of the big temples at these places. In former days, the
profession was countenanced not only by the church, but also by the
State. Abdur Razaak, a Turkish ambassador at the court of Vijayanagar
in the fifteenth century, describes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2592src"
href="#xd21e2592" name="xd21e2592src">13</a> women of this class as
living in State-controlled institutions, the revenue of which went
towards the upkeep of the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the present day they form a regular caste, having its own
laws of inheritance, its own customs and rules of etiquette, and its
own panch&#257;yats (councils) to see that all these are followed, and
thus hold a position, which is perhaps without a parallel in any other
country. Dancing-girls, dedicated to the usual profession of the caste,
are formally married in a temple to a sword or a god, the t&#257;li
(marriage badge) being tied round their necks by some men of their
caste. It was a standing puzzle to the census enumerators whether such
women should be entered as married in the column referring to civil
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the D&#257;sis, sons and daughters inherit equally,
contrary to ordinary Hindu usage. Some of the sons remain in the caste,
and live by playing music for the women to dance to, and accompaniments
to their songs, or by teaching singing and dancing to the younger
girls, and music to the boys. These are called Nattuvans. Others marry
some girl of the caste, who is too plain to be likely to be a success
in the profession, and drift out of the community. Some of these affix
to their names the terms Pillai and Mudali, which are the usual titles
of the two castes (Vell&#257;la and Kaik&#333;la) from which most of
the D&#257;sis are recruited, and try to live down the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>stigma attaching to their birth. Others join the
M&#275;lakk&#257;rans or professional musicians. Cases have occurred,
in which wealthy sons of dancing-women have been allowed to marry girls
of respectable parentage of other castes, but they are very rare. The
daughters of the caste, who are brought up to follow the caste
profession, are carefully taught dancing, singing, the art of dressing
well, and the <i>ars amoris</i>, and their success in keeping up their
clientele is largely due to the contrast which they thus present to the
ordinary Hindu housewife, whose ideas are bounded by the day&rsquo;s
dinner and the babies. The dancing-girl castes, and their allies the
M&#275;lakk&#257;rans, are now practically the sole repository of
Indian music, the system of which is probably one of the oldest in the
world. Besides them and the Br&#257;hmans, few study the subject. The
barbers&rsquo; bands of the villages usually display more energy than
science. A notable exception, however, exists in Madras city, which has
been known to attempt the Dead March in Saul at funerals in the Pariah
quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two divisions among the D&#257;sis, called Valangai
(right-hand) and Idangai (left-hand). The chief distinction between
them is that the former will have nothing to do with the Kamm&#257;lans
(artisans) or any other of the left-hand castes, or play or sing in
their houses. The latter division is not so particular, and its members
are consequently sometimes known as the Kamm&#257;la D&#257;sis.
Neither division, however, is allowed to have any dealings with men of
the lowest castes, and violation of this rule of etiquette is tried by
a panch&#257;yat of the caste, and visited with excommunication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Telugu districts, the dancing-girls are called
B&#333;gams and S&#257;nis. They are supposed to be dedicated to the
gods, just as the D&#257;sis are, but there is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>only
one temple in the northern part of the Presidency which maintains a
corps of these women in the manner in vogue further south. This
exception is the shrine of Sr&#299; Kurmam in Vizagapatam, the
dancing-girls attached to which are known as Kurmapus. In Vizagapatam
most of the B&#333;gams and S&#257;nis belong to the
N&#257;gav&#257;sulu and Palli castes, and their male children often
call themselves N&#257;gav&#257;sulus, but in Nellore, Kurnool and
Bellary they are often Balijas and Yerukalas. In Nellore the
B&#333;gams are said to decline to sing in the houses of K&#333;matis.
The men of the S&#257;nis do not act as accompanists to their women at
nautch parties, as B&#333;gam and D&#257;si men do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Oriya country the dancing-girl caste is called Guni,
but there they have even less connection with the temples than the
B&#333;gams and S&#257;nis, not being even dedicated to the god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Canarese (or western) t&#257;luks of Bellary, and in
the adjoining parts of Dharwar and Mysore, a curious custom obtains
among the B&#333;yas, B&#275;darus, and certain other castes, under
which a family which has no male issue must dedicate one of its
daughters as a Basavi. The girl is taken to a temple, and married there
to the god, a t&#257;li and toe-rings being put on her, and
thenceforward she becomes a public woman, except that she does not
consort with any one of lower caste than herself. She is not, however,
despised on this account, and indeed at weddings she prepares the
t&#257;li (perhaps because she can never be a widow). Contrary to all
Hindu Law, she shares in the family property as though she was a son,
but her right to do so has not yet been confirmed by the Civil Courts.
If she has a son, he takes her father&rsquo;s name, but if only a
daughter, that daughter again becomes a Basavi. The children of Basavis
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>marry within their own caste, without
restrictions of any kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Malabar there is no regular community of dancing-girls;
nor is there among the Mussalmans of any part of the
Presidency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; Monier Williams writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2621src" href="#xd21e2621" name="xd21e2621src">14</a>
&ldquo;D&#257;sis drive a profitable trade under the sanction of
religion, and some courtesans have been known to amass enormous
fortunes. Nor do they think it inconsistent with their method of making
money to spend it in works of piety. Here and there Indian bridges and
other useful public works owe their existence to the liberality of the
frail sisterhood.&rdquo; The large tank (lake) at Channarayapatna in
Mysore was built by two dancing-girls.</p>
<p>In the Travancore Census Report, 1901, the D&#257;sis of the
Coromandel coast are compared, in the words of a Sanskrit poet, to
walking flesh-trees bearing golden fruits. The observant Abb&eacute;
Dubois noticed that, of all the women in India, it is especially the
courtesans who are the most decently clothed, as experience has taught
them that for a woman to display her charms damps sensual ardour
instead of exciting it, and that the imagination is more easily
captivated than the eye.</p>
<p>It was noticed by Lord Dufferin, on the occasion of a Viceregal
visit to Madura, that the front part of the dress of the dancing-girls
hangs in petticoats, but the back is only trousers.</p>
<p>The Rev. A. Marg&ouml;schis writes in connection with the practice
of dilating the lobes of the ears in Tinnevelly, that, as it was once
the fashion and a mark of respectability to have long ears, so now the
converse is true. Until a few years ago, if a woman had short ears, she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>was asked if she was a D&#275;va-d&#257;si,
because that class kept their ears natural. Now, with the change of
customs all round, even dancing-girls are found with long ears.
&ldquo;The dancing-girls are,&rdquo; the Rev. M. Phillips
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2632src" href="#xd21e2632" name=
"xd21e2632src">15</a> &ldquo;the most accomplished women among the
Hindus. They read, write, sing and play as well as dance. Hence one of
the great objections urged at first against the education of girls was
&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want our daughters to become
dancing-girls&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is on record<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2637src" href=
"#xd21e2637" name="xd21e2637src">16</a> that, in 1791, the Nabob of the
Carnatic dined with the Governor of Madras, and that, after dinner,
they were diverted with the dancing wenches, and the Nabob was
presented with cordial waters, French brandy and embroidered China
quilts. The story is told of a Governor of Madras in more recent times,
who, ignorant of the inverse method of beckoning to a person to advance
or retreat in the East, was scandalised when a nautch girl advanced
rapidly, till he thought she was going to sit in his lap. At a nautch
in the fort of the Mandasa Zemindar in honour of Sir M. E. Grant
Duff,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2640src" href="#xd21e2640" name=

to their neighbours. In the Vizagapatam and God&#257;vari jungles,
natives apostrophise tigers as Bussy. Whether the name is connected
with Bussy I know not.</p>

account was published in 1801.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2645src"

<p>General Burton narrates<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2655src" href=
"#xd21e2655" name="xd21e2655src">19</a> how a civilian of the old
school built a house at Bhav&#257;ni, and established a <i>corps de
ballet</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a set of nautch girls, whose accomplishments
actually extended to singing God save the King, and this was kept up by
their descendants, so that, when he visited the place in 1852, he was
&ldquo;greeted by the whole party, bedizened in all their finery, and
squalling the national anthem as if they understood it, which they did
not.&rdquo; With this may be contrasted a circular from a modern
European official, which states that &ldquo;during my jamabandy (land
revenue settlement) tour, people have sometimes been kind enough to
arrange singing or dancing parties, and, as it would have been
discourteous to decline to attend what had cost money to arrange, I
have accepted the compliment in the spirit in which it was offered. I
should, however, be glad if you would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>let it be generally
known that I am entirely in accord with what is known as the
anti-nautch movement in regard to such performances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was unanimously decided, in 1905, by the Executive Committee of
the Prince and Princess of Wales&rsquo; reception fund, that there
should be no performance by nautch girls at the entertainment to be
given to Their Royal Highnesses at Madras.</p>
<p>In a note on Basavis, the Collector of the Bellary district writes
that &ldquo;it is usual among Hindus to dedicate a bull for public use
on the death of a member of their family. These are the breeding bulls
of the village flock. Similarly, cows are dedicated, and are called
Basavis. No stigma attaches to Basavis or their children, and they are
received on terms of equality by other members of their caste. The
origin of the institution, it has been suggested, may probably be
traced to the time when the B&#333;yas, and other castes which dedicate
Basavis, were soldiers, and the Basavis acted as camp-followers and
nurses of the wounded in battle. According to Hindu custom, the wives
of the men could not be taken from their homes, and, other women of the
caste being required to attend to their comforts, the institution of
Basavis might have been started; or, if they existed before then as
religious devotees attached to temples, they might have been pressed
into their service, and the number added to as occasion required. In
Narayand&#275;varkeri there are many B&#333;yas and many Basavis. On
the car-festival day, the B&#333;yas cannot take meals until the car is
taken back to its original place after the procession. Sometimes, owing
to some accident, this cannot be done the same day, and the car-drawing
B&#333;yas sleep near the car, and do not go to their houses. Then it
is their Basavis who bring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>them food, and not their
wives.&rdquo; At Adoni I have seen a Basavi, who was working at a
cotton press for a daily wage of three annas, in full dress on a
holiday in honour of a local deity, wearing an elaborately chased
silver waist belt and abundant silver jewelry. The following are
examples of petitions presented to a European Magistrate and
Superintendent of Police by girls who are about to become
Basavis:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>Petition of __________ aged about 17 or 18.</i></p>
<p>I have agreed to become a Basavi, and get myself stamped by my guru
(priest) according to the custom of my caste. I request that my proper
age, which entitles me to be stamped, may be personally ascertained,
and permission granted to be stamped.</p>
</div>
<p>The stamping refers to branding with the emblems of the chank and
chakram.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>Petition of _____ wife of _____.</i></p>
<p>I have got two daughters, aged 15 and 12 respectively. As I have no
male issues, I have got to necessarily celebrate the ceremony in the
temple in connection with the tying of the goddess&rsquo;s t&#257;li to
my two daughters under the orders of the guru, in accordance with the
customs of my caste. I, therefore, submit this petition for fear that
the authorities may raise any objection (under the Age of Consent Act).
I, therefore, request that the Honourable Court may be pleased to give
permission to the tying of the t&#257;li to my daughters.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>Petition of two girls, aged 17 to 19.</i></p>
<p>Our father and mother are dead. Now we wish to be like prostitutes,
as we are not willing to be married, and thus establish our house-name.
Our mother also was of this profession. We now request permission to be
prostitutes according to our religion, after we are sent before the
Medical Officer.</p>
</div>
<p>The permission referred to in the above petitions bears reference to
a decision of the High Court that, a girl who becomes a Basavi being
incapable of contracting a legal marriage, her dedication when a minor
is an offence under the Penal Code. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Adoni the dead body of a new-born infant was found in a ditch,
and a Basavi, working with others in a cotton factory, was suspected of
foul play. The station-house officer announced his intention of
visiting the factory, and she who was in a state of lactation, and
could produce no baby to account for her condition, would be the
culprit. Writing concerning the Basavis of the Bellary
district,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2704src" href="#xd21e2704" name=
"xd21e2704src">20</a> Mr. W. Francis tells us that &ldquo;parents
without male issue often, instead of adopting a son in the usual
manner, dedicate a daughter by a simple ceremony to the god of some
temple, and thenceforth, by immemorial custom, she may inherit her
parents&rsquo; property, and perform their funeral rites as if she was
a son. She does not marry, but lives in her parents&rsquo; house with
any man of equal or higher caste whom she may select, and her children
inherit her father&rsquo;s name and bedagu (sept), and not those of
their own father. If she has a son, he inherits her property; if she
has only a daughter, that daughter again becomes a Basavi. Parents
desiring male issue of their own, cure from sickness in themselves or
their children, or relief from some calamity, will similarly dedicate
their daughter. The children of a Basavi are legitimate, and neither
they nor their mothers are treated as being in any way inferior to
their fellows. A Basavi, indeed, from the fact that she can never be a
widow, is a most welcome guest at weddings. Basavis differ from the
ordinary dancing-girls dedicated at temples in that their duties in the
temples (which are confined to the shrine of their dedication) are
almost nominal, and that they do not prostitute themselves
promiscuously for hire. A Basavi very usually lives faithfully with one
man, who allows her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>a fixed sum weekly for her maintenance, and
a fixed quantity of new raiment annually, and she works for her family
as hard as any other woman. Basavis are outwardly indistinguishable
from other women, and are for the most part coolies. In places there is
a custom by which they are considered free to change their protectors
once a year at the village car-festival or some similar anniversary,
and they usually seize this opportunity of putting their
partner&rsquo;s affections to the test by suggesting that a new cloth
and bodice would be a welcome present. So poor, as a rule, are the
husbands that the police aver that the anniversaries are preceded by an
unusual crop of petty thefts and burglaries committed by them in their
efforts to provide their customary gifts.&rdquo; A recent report of a
Police Inspector in the Bellary district states that &ldquo;crimes are
committed here and there, as this is Nagarapanchami time.
Nagarapanchami festival is to be celebrated at the next Ammavasya or
new-moon day. It is at that time the people keeping the prostitutes
should pay their dues on that day; otherwise they will have their new
engagements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Kurnool district, the Basavi system is practised by the
B&#333;yas, but differs from that in vogue in Bellary and Mysore. The
object of making a Basavi, in these two localities, is to perpetuate
the family when there is no male heir. If the only issue in a family is
a female, the family becomes extinct if she marries, as by marriage she
changes her sept. To prevent this, she is not married, but dedicated as
a Basavi, and continues to belong to her father&rsquo;s sept, to which
also any male issue which is born to her belongs. In the Kurnool
district the motive in making Basavis is different. The girl is not
wedded to an idol, but, on an auspicious day, is tied by means of a
garland of flowers to the garuda kambham <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>(lamp) of a Balija
D&#257;sari. She is released either by the man who is to receive her
first favours, or by her maternal uncle. A simple feast is held, and a
string of black beads tied round the girl&rsquo;s neck. She becomes a
prostitute, and her children do not marry into respectable B&#333;ya
families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basava women,&rdquo; Dr. E. Balfour writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2715src" href="#xd21e2715" name="xd21e2715src">21</a>
&ldquo;are sometimes married to a dagger, sometimes to an idol. In
making a female child over to the service of the temple, she is taken
and dedicated for life to some idol. A khanjar, or dagger, is placed on
the ground, and the girl who is to undergo the ceremony puts a garland
thereon. Her mother then puts rice on the girl&rsquo;s forehead. The
officiating priest then weds the girl to the dagger, just as if he was
uniting her to a boy in marriage, by reciting the marriage stanzas, a
curtain being held between the girl and the dagger.&rdquo; In an
account of the initiation ceremony of the Basavis of the Bellary
district Mr. F. Fawcett writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2718src" href="#xd21e2718" name="xd21e2718src">22</a> &ldquo;A
sword with a lime stuck on its point is placed upright beside the
novice, and held in her right hand. It represents the bridegroom, who,
in the corresponding ceremony of Hindu marriage, sits on the
bride&rsquo;s right. A tray, on which are a kalasyam (vessel of water)
and a lamp, is then produced, and moved thrice in front of the girl.
She rises, and, carrying the sword in her right hand, places it in the
god&rsquo;s sanctuary. Among the dancing-girls very similar ceremonies
are performed. With them, the girl&rsquo;s spouse is represented by a
drum instead of a sword, and she bows to it. Her insignia consist of a
drum and bells.&rdquo; In a further note on the dedication of Basavis,
Mr. Fawcett writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2721src" href=
"#xd21e2721" name="xd21e2721src">23</a> that &ldquo;a t&#257;li,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>on which is depicted the n&#257;mam of Vishnu,
fastened to a necklace of black beads, is tied round her neck. She is
given by way of insignia a cane as a wand carried in the right hand,
and a gop&#257;lam or begging basket, which is slung on the left arm.
She is then branded with the emblems of the chank and chakra. In
another account<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2726src" href="#xd21e2726"
name="xd21e2726src">24</a> of the marriage ceremony among
dancing-girls, it is stated that the B&#333;gams, who are without
exception prostitutes, though they are not allowed to marry, go through
a marriage ceremony, which is rather a costly one. Sometimes a wealthy
Native bears the expense, makes large presents to the bride, and
receives her first favours. Where no such opportunity offers itself, a
sword or other weapon represents the bridegroom, and an imaginary
nuptial ceremony is performed. Should the B&#333;gam woman have no
daughter, she invariably adopts one, usually paying a price for her,
the Kaik&#333;la (weaver) caste being the ordinary one from which to
take a child.</p>
<p>Among the Kaik&#333;lan musicians of Coimbatore, at least one girl
in every family should be set apart for the temple service, and she is
instructed in music and dancing. At the t&#257;li-tying ceremony she is
decorated with jewels, and made to stand on a heap of paddy (unhusked
rice). A folded cloth is held before her by two D&#257;sis, who also
stand on heaps of paddy. The girl catches hold of the cloth, and her
dancing master, who is seated behind her, grasping her legs, moves them
up and down in time with the music which is played. In the evening she
is taken, astride a pony, to the temple, where a new cloth for the
idol, the t&#257;li, and other articles required for doing p&#363;ja
(worship) have been got ready. The girl is seated facing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>the
idol, and the officiating Br&#257;hman gives sandal and flowers to her,
and ties the t&#257;li, which has been lying at the feet of the idol,
round her neck. The t&#257;li consists of a golden disc and black
beads. She continues to learn music and dancing, and eventually goes
through the form of a nuptial ceremony, The relations are invited on an
auspicious day, and the maternal uncle, or his representative, ties a
golden band on the girl&rsquo;s forehead, and, carrying her, places her
on a plank before the assembled guests. A Br&#257;hman priest recites
mantrams (prayers), and prepares the sacred fire (h&#333;mam). For the
actual nuptials a rich Br&#257;hman, if possible, and, if not, a
Br&#257;hman of more lowly status is invited. A Br&#257;hman is called
in, as he is next in importance to, and the representative of, the
idol. As a D&#257;si can never become a widow, the beads in her
t&#257;li are considered to bring good luck to women who wear them. And
some people send the t&#257;li required for a marriage to a D&#257;si,
who prepares the string for it, and attaches to it black beads from her
own t&#257;li. A D&#257;si is also deputed to walk at the head of Hindu
marriage processions. Married women do not like to do this, as they are
not proof against evil omens, which the procession may meet. And it is
believed that D&#257;sis, to whom widowhood is unknown, possess the
power of warding off the effects of inauspicious omens. It may be
remarked, <i>en passant</i>, that D&#257;sis are not at the present day
so much patronised at Hindu marriages as in olden times. Much is due in
this direction to the progress of enlightened ideas, which have of late
been strongly put forward by Hindu social reformers. When a
Kaik&#333;lan D&#257;si dies, her body is covered with a new cloth
removed from the idol, and flowers are supplied from the temple, to
which she belonged. No p&#363;ja is performed in the temple till the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>corpse is disposed of, as the idol, being her
husband, has to observe pollution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In former times, dancing-girls used to sleep three nights at
the commencement of their career in the inner shrine of the
Kopp&#275;svara temple at Palivela in the God&#257;vari district, so as
to be embraced by the god. But one of them, it is said, disappeared one
night, and the practice has ceased. The funeral pyre of every girl of
the dancing girl (S&#257;ni) caste dying in the village should be lit
with fire brought from the temple. The same practice is found in the
Sr&#299;rangam temple near Trichinopoly.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2740src" href="#xd21e2740" name="xd21e2740src">25</a></p>
<p>The following account of D&#257;sis in Travancore, where their total
strength is only about four hundred, is taken from a note by Mr. N.
Subramani Aiyer. &ldquo;While the D&#257;sis of Kartikappalli,
Ambalapuzha, and Shertallay belonged originally to the Konkan coast,
those of Shenkottah belonged to the P&#257;ndian country. But the South
Travancore D&#257;sis are an indigenous class. The female members of
the caste are, besides being known by the ordinary name of
T&#275;vadiy&#257;l and D&#257;si, both meaning servant of God, called
Kudikkar, meaning those belonging to the house (<i>i.e.</i>, given rent
free by the Sirkar), and Pendukal, or women, the former of these
designations being more popular than the latter. Males are called
T&#275;vadiyan, though many prefer to be known as Nanchin&#257;t
Vell&#257;las. Males, like these Vell&#257;las, take the title of
Pillai. In ancient days D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, who became experts in
singing and dancing, received the title of R&#257;yar (king) which
appears to have been last conferred in 1847 A.D. The South Travancore
D&#257;sis neither interdine nor intermarry with the dancing-girls of
the Tamil-speaking districts. They adopt girls only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>from
a particular division of the N&#257;yars, Tamil Padam, and dance only
in temples. Unlike their sisters outside Travancore, they do not accept
private engagements in houses on the occasion of marriage. The males,
in a few houses, marry the Tamil Padam and Padamangalam N&#257;yars,
while some Padamangalam N&#257;yars and Nanchin&#257;t Vell&#257;las in
their turn take their women as wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a dancing-woman becomes too old or diseased, and thus
unable to perform her usual temple duties, she applies to the temple
authorities for permission to remove her ear-pendants (todus). The
ceremony takes place at the palace of the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. At the
appointed spot the officers concerned assemble, and the woman, seated
on a wooden plank, proceeds to unhook the pendants, and places them,
with a nuzzur (gift) of twelve fanams (coins), on the plank. Directly
after this she turns about, and walks away without casting a second
glance at the ear-ornaments which have been laid down. She becomes
immediately a taikkizhavi or old mother, and is supposed to lead a life
of retirement and resignation. By way of distinction, a D&#257;si in
active service is referred to as &#257;tump&#257;tram. Though the
ear-ornaments are at once returned to her from the palace, the woman is
never again permitted to put them on, but only to wear the pampadam, or
antiquated ear-ornament of Tamil S&#363;dra women. Her temple wages
undergo a slight reduction, consequent on her proved incapacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some temples, as at K&#275;ralapuram, there are two
divisions of dancing-girls, one known as the Murakkudi to attend to the
daily routine, the other as the Chirappukuti to serve on special
occasions. The special duties that may be required of the South
Travancore D&#257;sis are:&mdash;(1) to attend the two Utsavas at Sri
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>Padman&#257;bahsw&#257;mi&rsquo;s temple, and
the Dusserah at the capital; (2) to meet and escort members of the
royal family at their respective village limits; (3) to undertake the
prescribed fasts for the Apamargam ceremony in connection with the
annual festival of the temple. On these days strict continence is
enjoined, and they are fed at the temple, and allowed only one meal a
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal deities of the dancing-girls are those to whom
the temples, in which they are employed, are dedicated. They observe
the new and full-moon days, and the last Friday of every month as
important. The Onam, Sivar&#257;tri, Tye-Pongal, D&#299;p&#257;vali,
and Chitrapurnami are the best recognised religious festivals. Minor
deities, such as Bhadrak&#257;li, Yakshi, and Ghandarva are worshipped
by the figure of a trident or sword being drawn on the wall of the
house, to which food and sweetmeats are offered on Fridays. The priests
on these occasions are &#332;cchans. There are no recognized headmen in
the caste. The services of Br&#257;hmans are resorted to for the
purpose of purification, of Nampiyans and Saiva Vell&#257;las for the
performance of funeral rites, and of Kurukkals on occasions of
marriage, and for the final ceremonies on the sixteenth day after
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls belonging to this caste may either be dedicated to
temple service, or married to a male member of the caste. No woman can
be dedicated to the temple after she has reached puberty. On the
occasion of marriage, a sum of from fifty to a hundred and fifty rupees
is given to the bride&rsquo;s house, not as a bride-price, but for
defraying the marriage expenses. There is a preliminary ceremony of
betrothal, and the marriage is celebrated at an auspicious hour. The
Kurukkal recites a few hymns, and the ceremonies, which include the
tying of the t&#257;li, continue for four days. The couple <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>commence joint life on the sixteenth day after
the girl has reached puberty. It is easy enough to get a divorce, as
this merely depends upon the will of one of the two parties, and the
woman becomes free to receive clothes from another person in token of
her having entered into a fresh matrimonial alliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All applications for the presentation of a girl to the temple
are made to the temple authorities by the senior dancing-girl of the
temple, the girl to be presented being in all cases from six to eight
years of age. If she is closely related to the applicant, no enquiries
regarding her status and claim need be made. In all other cases, formal
investigations are instituted, and the records taken are submitted to
the chief revenue officer of the division for orders. Some paddy (rice)
and five fanams are given to the family from the temple funds towards
the expenses of the ceremony. The practice at the Suchindrum temple is
to convene, on an auspicious day, a y&#333;ga or meeting, composed of
the Valiya Sri-kariyakkar, the Yogattil Potti, the Vattappalli Muttatu,
and others, at which the preliminaries are arranged. The girl bathes,
and goes to the temple on the morning of the selected day with two new
cloths, betel leaves and nuts. The temple priest places the cloths and
the t&#257;li at the feet of the image, and sets apart one for the
divine use. The t&#257;li consists of a triangular bottu, bearing the
image of Gan&#275;sa, with a gold bead on either side. Taking the
remaining cloth and the t&#257;li, and sitting close to the girl, the
priest, facing to the north, proceeds to officiate. The girl sits,
facing the deity, in the inner sanctuary. The priest kindles the fire,
and performs all the marriage ceremonies, following the custom of the
Tirukkaly&#257;nam festival, when Siva is represented as marrying
Parvati. He then teaches the girl the Panchakshara hymn if the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>temple is Saivite, and Ashtakshara if it is
Vaishnavite, presents her with the cloth, and ties the t&#257;li round
her neck. The Nattuvan, or dancing-master, instructs her for the first
time in his art, and a quantity of raw rice is given to her by the
temple authorities. The girl, thus married, is taken to her house,
where the marriage festivities are celebrated for two or three days. As
in Br&#257;hmanical marriages, the rolling of a cocoanut to and fro is
gone through, the temple priest or an elderly D&#257;si, dressed in
male attire, acting the part of the bridegroom. The girl is taken in
procession through the streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The birth of male children is not made an occasion for
rejoicing, and, as the proverb goes, the lamp on these occasions is
only dimly lighted. Inheritance is in the female line, and women are
the absolute owners of all property earned. When a dancing-girl dies,
some paddy and five fanams are given from the temple to which she was
attached, to defray the funeral expenses. The temple priest gives a
garland, and a quantity of ashes for decorating the corpse. After this,
a Nampiyan, an &#332;cchan, some Vell&#257;la headmen, and a Kudikkari,
having no pollution, assemble at the house of the deceased. The
Nampiyan consecrates a pot of water with prayers, the &#332;cchan plays
on his musical instrument, and the Vell&#257;las and Kudikkari powder
the turmeric to be smeared over the corpse. In the case of temple
devotees, their dead bodies must be bathed with this substance by the
priest, after which alone the funeral ceremonies may proceed. The
Kart&#257; (chief mourner), who is the nearest male relative, has to
get his whole head shaved. When a temple priest dies, though he is a
Br&#257;hman, the dancing-girl, on whom he has performed the vicarious
marriage rite, has to go to his death-bed, and prepare the turmeric
powder to be dusted over his corpse. The anniversary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of
the death of the mother and maternal uncle are invariably observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The adoption of a dancing-girl is a lengthy ceremony. The
application to the temple authorities takes the form of a request that
the girl to be adopted may be made heir to both kuti and pati, that is,
to the house and temple service of the person adopting. The sanction of
the authorities having been obtained, all concerned meet at the house
of the person who is adopting, a document is executed, and a ceremony,
of the nature of the J&#257;takarma, performed. The girl then goes
through the marriage rite, and is handed over to the charge of the
music teacher to be regularly trained in her profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As bearing on the initiation, laws of inheritance, etc., of
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, the following cases, which have been argued in
the Madras High Court, may be quoted<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2775src" href="#xd21e2775" name="xd21e2775src">26</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) In a charge against a dancing-girl of having purchased a
young girl, aged five, with the intent that she would be used for the
purpose of prostitution, or knowing it to be likely that she would be
so used, evidence was given of the fact of purchase for sixty rupees,
and that numerous other dancing-girls, residing in the neighbourhood,
were in the habit of obtaining girls and bringing them up as
dancing-girls or prostitutes, and that there were no instances of girls
brought up by dancing-girls ever having been married. One witness
stated that there were forty dancing-girls&rsquo; houses in the town
(Ad&#333;ni), and that their chief source of income was prostitution,
and that the dancing-girls, who have no daughters of their own, get
girls from others, bring them up, and eventually make them
dancing-girls or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>prostitutes. He added that the
dancing-girls get good incomes by bringing up girls in preference to
boys. Another witness stated that dancing-girls, when they grow old,
obtain girls and bring them up to follow their profession, and that
good-looking girls are generally bought.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2787src" href="#xd21e2787" name="xd21e2787src">27</a></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The evidence showed that two of the prisoners were
dancing-girls of a certain temple, that one of them took the two
daughters of the remaining prisoner to the pagoda, to be marked as
dancing-girls, and that they were so marked, and their names entered in
the accounts of the pagoda. The first prisoner (the mother of the
girls) disposed of the children to the third prisoner for the
consideration of a neck ornament and thirty-five rupees. The children
appeared to be of the ages of seven and two years, respectively.
Evidence was taken, which tended to prove that dancing-girls gain their
livelihood by the performance of certain offices in pagodas, by
assisting in the performance of ceremonies in private houses, by
dancing and singing upon the occasion of marriage, and by
prostitution.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2795src" href="#xd21e2795"
name="xd21e2795src">28</a></p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The first prisoner presented an application for the
enrolment of his daughter as a dancing-girl at one of the great
pagodas. He stated her age to be thirteen. She attained puberty a month
or two after her enrolment. Her father was the servant of a
dancing-girl, the second prisoner, who had been teaching the minor
dancing for some five years. The evidence showed that the second
prisoner brought the girl to the pagoda, that both first and second
prisoners were present when the bottu (or t&#257;li) was tied, and
other ceremonies of the dedication performed; that third prisoner, as
Battar of the temple, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>was the person who actually tied
the bottu, which denotes that the D&#257;si is wedded to the idol.
There was the usual evidence that dancing-girls live by prostitution,
though occasionally kept by the same man for a year or more.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2807src" href="#xd21e2807" name=
"xd21e2807src">29</a></p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The plaintiff, a D&#275;va-d&#257;si, complained that,
when she brought offerings according to custom and placed them before
the God at a certain festival, and asked the Archakas (officiating
priests) to present the offerings to the God, burn incense, and then
distribute them, they refused to take the offerings on the ground that
the D&#275;va-d&#257;si had gone to a K&#333;mati&rsquo;s house to
dance. She claimed damages, Rs. 10, for the rejected offerings, and Rs.
40 for loss of honour, and a perpetual injunction to allow her to
perform the mantapa hadi (sacrifice) at the Chittrai Vasanta festival.
The priests pleaded that the dancing-girl had, for her bad conduct in
having danced at a K&#333;mati&rsquo;s house, and subsequently refused
to expiate the deed by drinking panchagavyan (five products of the cow)
according to the shastras, been expelled both from her caste and from
the temple.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2817src" href="#xd21e2817" name=
"xd21e2817src">30</a></p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) In a certain temple two dancing-girls were dedicated by
the Dharmakarta to the services of the temple without the consent of
the existing body of dancing-girls, and the suit was instituted against
the Dharmakarta and these two D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, asking that the
Court should ascertain and declare the rights of the
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis of the pagoda in regard (1) to the dedication of
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, (2) to the Dharmakarta&rsquo;s power to bind and
suspend them; and that the Court should ascertain and declare the
rights of the plaintiff, the existing D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, as to the
exclusion of all other D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>save
those who are related to or adopted by some one of the
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis for the time being, or those who, being approved
by all, are elected and proposed to the Dharmakarta for dedication.
That the new D&#257;sis may be declared to have been improperly
dedicated, and not entitled to any of the rights of
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, and restrained from attending the pagoda in that
character, and from interfering with the duly dedicated
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis in the exercise of their office. That first
defendant be restrained from stamping and dedicating other
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis but such as are duly approved. The Judge dismissed
the case on the ground that it would be contrary to public policy to
make the declaration prayed for, as, in so doing, the Court would be
lending itself to bringing the parties under the criminal law. In the
appeal, which was dismissed, one of the Judges remarked that the
plaintiffs claimed a right exclusive to themselves and a few other
dancing-women, professional prostitutes, to present infant female
children for dedication to the temple as dancing-girls to be stamped as
such, and so accredited to become at maturity professional prostitutes,
private or public.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2829src" href=
"#xd21e2829" name="xd21e2829src">31</a></p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) A D&#275;va-d&#257;si sued to establish her right to the
mir&#257;si (fees) of dancing-girls in a certain pagoda, and to be put
in possession of the said mir&#257;si together with the honours and
perquisites attached thereto, and to recover twenty-four rupees, being
the value of said perquisites and honours for the year preceding. She
alleged that the Dharmakarta of the pagoda and his agents wrongfully
dismissed her from the office because she had refused to acquiesce in
the admission by the Dharmakarta of new dancing-girls into the pagoda
service, of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>which she claimed the monopoly for herself and
the then existing families of dancing-girls. The District Judge
dismissed the suit, but the High Court ordered a re-investigation as to
the question of the existence of an hereditary office with endowments
or emoluments attached to it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2841src" href=
"#xd21e2841" name="xd21e2841src">32</a></p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) A girl, aged seventeen, instituted a suit against the
trustees of a pagoda. It was alleged that a woman who died some years
previously was one of the dancing-women attached to the pagoda, and, as
such, entitled to the benefit of one of the temple endowments; that she
had taken in adoption the plaintiff, who was accordingly entitled to
succeed to her office and the emoluments attached to it; that the
plaintiff could not enter on the office until a bottu-t&#257;li had
been tied on her in the temple; and that the trustees did not permit
this to be done. The prayer of the plaint was that the defendants be
compelled to allow the t&#257;li to be tied in the temple in view to
the girl performing the dancing service, and enjoying the honours and
endowments attached thereto. The Judge dismissed the suit on the ground
that the claim was inadmissible, as being in effect a claim by the
plaintiff to be enlisted as a public prostitute.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2851src" href="#xd21e2851" name="xd21e2851src">33</a></p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) On the death of a prostitute dancing-girl, her adopted
niece, belonging to the same class, succeeds to her property, in
whatever way it is acquired, in preference to a brother remaining in
his caste. The general rule is that the legal relation between a
prostitute dancing-girl and her undegraded relations remaining in caste
be severed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2862src" href="#xd21e2862" name=
"xd21e2862src">34</a></p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) A pauper sued his sister for the partition of property
valued at Rs. 34,662. The parties belonged to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>the
B&#333;gam caste in the God&#257;vari district. The woman pleaded that
the property had been acquired by her as a prostitute, and denied her
brother&rsquo;s claim to it. He obtained a decree for only Rs. 100,
being a moiety of the property left by their mother. The High Court
held, on the evidence as to the local custom of the caste, that the
decree was right.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2874src" href="#xd21e2874"
name="xd21e2874src">35</a></p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) The accused, a M&#257;diga of the Bellary district,
dedicated his minor daughter as a Basavi by a form of marriage with an
idol. It appeared that a Basavi is incapable of contracting a lawful
marriage, and ordinarily practices promiscuous intercourse with men,
and that her sons succeed to her father&rsquo;s property. It was held
that the accused had committed an offence under the Penal Code, which
lays down that &ldquo;whoever sells, lets to hire, or otherwise
disposes of any minor under the age of sixteen years, with intent that
such minor shall be employed or used for the purpose of prostitution,
or for any unlawful and immoral purpose, shall be punished, etc.&rdquo;
The Sessions judge referred to evidence that it was not a matter of
course for Basavis to prostitute themselves for money, and added:
&ldquo;The evidence is very clear that Basavis are made in accordance
with a custom of the M&#257;diga caste. It is also in evidence that one
of the effects of making a girl Basavi is that her male issue becomes a
son of her father, and perpetuates his family, whereas, if she were
married, he would perpetuate her husband&rsquo;s family. In this
particular case, the girl was made a Basavi that she might be heir to
her aunt, who was a Basavi, but childless. Siddalingana Gowd says that
they and their issue inherit the parents&rsquo; property. There is
evidence that Basavis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>are made on a very large scale,
and that they live in their parents&rsquo; houses. There is no evidence
that they are regarded otherwise than as respectable members of the
caste. It seems as if the Basavi is the M&#257;diga and B&#275;dar
equivalent of the &ldquo;appointed daughter&rdquo; of Hindu law
(Mitakshara, Chap. I, s. xi, 3). Upon the whole, the evidence seems to
establish that, among the M&#257;digas, there is a widespread custom of
performing, in a temple at Uchangidurgam, a marriage ceremony, the
result of which is that the girl is married without possibility of
widowhood or divorce; that she is at liberty to have intercourse with
men at her pleasure; that her children are heirs to her father, and
keep up his family; and that Basavi&rsquo;s nieces, being made Basavis,
become their heirs. The Basavis seem in some cases to become
prostitutes, but the language used by the witnesses generally points
only to free intercourse with men, and not necessarily to receipt of
payment for use of their bodies. In fact, they seem to acquire the
right of intercourse with men without more discredit than accrues to
the men of their caste for intercourse with women who are not their
wives.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2886src" href="#xd21e2886" name=
"xd21e2886src">36</a></p>
<p>It may be observed that D&#275;va-d&#257;sis are the only class of
women, who are, under Hindu law as administered in the British Courts,
allowed to adopt girls to themselves. Amongst the other castes, a
widow, for instance, cannot adopt to herself, but only to her husband,
and she cannot adopt a daughter instead of a son. A recent attempt by a
Br&#257;hman at Poona to adopt a daughter, who should take the place of
a natural-born daughter, was held to be invalid by general law, and not
sanctioned by local usage.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2893src" href=
"#xd21e2893" name="xd21e2893src">37</a> The same would be held in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>Madras. &ldquo;But among dancing-girls,&rdquo;
Mayne writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2901src" href="#xd21e2901"
name="xd21e2901src">38</a> &ldquo;it is customary in Madras and Western
India to adopt girls to follow their adoptive mother&rsquo;s
profession, and the girls so adopted succeed to their property. No
particular ceremonies are necessary, recognition alone being
sufficient. In the absence, however, of a special custom, and on the
analogy of an ordinary adoption, only one girl can be adopted.&rdquo;
In Calcutta and Bombay these adoptions by dancing-girls have been held
invalid.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2904src" href="#xd21e2904" name=
"xd21e2904src">39</a></p>
<p>Of proverbs relating to dancing-girls, the following may be
quoted:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The dancing-girl who could not dance said that the hall was not
big enough. The Rev. H. Jensen gives<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2911src" href="#xd21e2911" name="xd21e2911src">40</a> as an
equivalent &ldquo;When the devil could not swim, he laid the blame on
the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2) If the dancing-girl be alive, and her mother dies, there will be
beating of drums; but, if the dancing-girl dies, there will be no such
display. This is explained by Jensen as meaning that, to secure the
favour of a dancing-girl, many men will attend her mother&rsquo;s
funeral; but, if the dancing-girl herself dies, there is nothing to be
gained by attending the funeral.</p>
<p>(3) Like a dancing-girl wiping a child. Jensen remarks that a
dancing-girl is supposed to have no children, so she does not know how
to keep them clean. Said of one who tries to mend a matter, but lacks
experience, and makes things worse than they were before.</p>
<p>(4) As when a boy is born in a dancing-girl&rsquo;s house. Jensen
notes that, if dancing-girls have children, they desire to have girls,
that they may be brought up to their own profession. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>(5) The dancing-girl, who was formerly more than filled with good
food in the temple, now turns a somersault to get a poor man&rsquo;s
rice.</p>
<p>(6) If a matron is chaste, she may live in the dancing-girl&rsquo;s
street,</p>
<p>The insigne of courtesans, according to the Conjeeveram records, is
a Cupid, that of a Christian, a curry-comb.<a class="noteref" id=

<p><b>D&#275;v&#257;diga.</b>&mdash;The D&#275;v&#257;digas are
Canarese-speaking temple servants in South Canara, concerning whom Mr.
H. A. Stuart writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2935src"
href="#xd21e2935" name="xd21e2935src">42</a> &ldquo;This is a class of
servants, chiefly musicians in Hindu temples. In the reign of
May&#363;ra Varma, who built a number of new temples, it was found that
Br&#257;hmans could not perform all the services. It was, therefore,
ordained by him that the p&#363;ja or worship alone should be performed
by the Br&#257;hmans, and that the Stanikas and D&#275;v&#257;digas
should perform the other services in the temples. They are also called
Moili (or Moyili), but there is a caste called Kannada Moili which is
quite distinct, and D&#275;v&#257;digas will not eat with them. Some of
them cultivate lands, and some are employed as peons and constables.
They returned eleven sub-divisions, but only one (Tulu) is numerically
important. They are Vaishnavites, and Tulu Br&#257;hmans are their
priests. As regards marriage, there is no fixed age. Remarriage of
widows is permitted, but it is practiced only in the case of young
widows. The dead are burned. They eat flesh, and drink
liquor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&#275;v&#257;digas or Moilis speak Tulu, and are mainly
agriculturists. Their traditional occupation, however, is said to be
service in temples (slaves or servants of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>d&#275;va or god). A large number of them, both
male and female, are engaged as domestic servants. Like the Bants, they
follow the aliya sant&#257;na law of inheritance (in the female line),
and they have the same balis (septs) as the Bants and Billavas. In
their marriage ceremonies, they closely imitate the Bants. An
interesting feature in connection therewith is that, during the
dh&#257;re ceremony, a screen is interposed between the bride and
bridegroom at the time when the dh&#257;re water is poured. As a sign
of betrothal, a ring is given to the bride-elect, and she wears it on
the little finger. The caste is a mixed one, and here and there
D&#275;v&#257;digas are seen to have the typical prominent cheek-bones
and square face of the Jains.</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Dakkera D&#275;vali, Padarti, and
V&#257;lagadava are returned as sub-divisions of
D&#275;v&#257;diga.</p>
<p><b>D&#275;vala</b> (belonging to God).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Odd&#275;. The equivalent D&#275;vali has been recorded as a sub-caste
of D&#275;v&#257;diga, and D&#275;valyal as a division of the

connected my operations in a vague way with the pil&#257;g (plague)
tax, and collection of subscriptions for the Victoria Memorial. They
were employed in weaving women&rsquo;s s&#257;ris in pure cotton, or
with a silk border, which were sold to rich merchants in the local
bazaar, some of whom belong to the D&#275;v&#257;nga caste. They
laughingly said that, though they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>professional weavers,
they find it cheapest to wear cloths of European manufacture.</p>

<p>The D&#275;v&#257;ngas are also called J&#257;daru or J&#257;da
(great men), D&#275;ndra, D&#275;vara, D&#275;ra, S&#275;niyan, and
S&#275;dan. At Coimbatore, in the Tamil country, they are called
Settukk&#257;ran (economical people).</p>
<p>The following legend is narrated concerning the origin of the caste.
Brahma, having created Manu, told him to weave clothes for D&#275;vas
and men. Accordingly Manu continued to weave for some years, and
reached heaven through his piety and virtuous life. There being no one
left to weave for them, the D&#275;vas and men had to wear garments of
leaves. Vexed at this, they prayed to Brahma that he would rescue them
from their plight. Brahma took them to Siva, who at once created a
lustrous spirit, and called him D&#275;valan. Struck with the
brilliancy thereof, all fled in confusion, excepting Parvati, who
remained near Siva. Siva told her that D&#275;valan was created to
weave clothes, to cover the limbs and bodies of D&#275;vas and men,
whose descendants are in consequence called D&#275;v&#257;ngas
(D&#275;va angam, limb of god). D&#275;valan was advised to obtain
thread from the lotus stalks springing from the navel of Vishnu, and he
secured them after a severe penance. On his way back, he met a
R&#257;kshasa, Vajradantan by name, who was doing penance at a
hermitage, disguised as a Sany&#257;si. Deceived by his appearance,
D&#275;valan paid homage to him, and determined to spend the night at
the hermitage. But, towards the close of the day, the Rishi and his
followers threw off their disguise, and appeared in their true colours
as Asuras. D&#275;valan sought the assistance of Vishnu, and a chakra
was given to him, with which he attempted to overthrow the increasing
number of Asuras. He then invoked the assistance of Chaudan&#257;yaki
or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>Chaud&#275;swari, who came riding on a lion, and
the Asuras were killed off. The mighty Asuras who met their death were
Vajradantan (diamond-toothed), Pugainethran (smoke-eyed), Pugaimugan
(smoke-faced), Chithras&#275;nan (leader of armies) and Jeyadrathan
(owner of a victory-securing car). The blood of these five was coloured
respectively yellow, red, white, green, and black. For dyeing threads
of different colours, D&#275;valan dipped them in the blood. The
D&#275;v&#257;ngas claim to be the descendants of D&#275;valan, and say
that they are D&#275;v&#257;nga Br&#257;hmans, on the strength of the
following stanza, which seems to have been composed by a
D&#275;v&#257;nga priest, Sambalinga Murti by name:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Manu was born in the Br&#257;hman caste.</p>
<p class="line">He was surely a Br&#257;hman in the womb.</p>
<p class="line">There is no Sudraism in this caste.</p>
<p class="line">D&#275;vanga had the form of Br&#257;hma.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The legendary origin of the D&#275;v&#257;ngas is
given as follows in the Baramahal Records.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2979src" href="#xd21e2979" name="xd21e2979src">44</a> &ldquo;When
Brahma the creator created the charam and acharam, or the animate and
inanimate creation, the D&#275;vatas or gods, R&#257;kshasas or evil
demons, and the human race, were without a covering for their bodies,
which displeasing the god Narada or reason, he waited upon
Param&#275;shwara or the great Lord at his palace on the Kail&#257;sa
Parvata or mount of paradise, and represented the indecent state of the
inhabitants of the universe, and prayed that he would be pleased to
devise a covering for their nakedness. Param&#275;shwara saw the
propriety of Narada&rsquo;s request, and thought it was proper to grant
it. While he was so thinking, a male sprang into existence from his
body, whom he named D&#275;va angam <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>or the body of God,
in allusion to the manner of his birth. D&#275;va angam instantly asked
his progenitor why he had created him. The God answered &lsquo;Repair
to the p&#257;la samudram or sea of milk, where you will find Sri Maha
Vishnu or the august mighty god Vishnu, and he will tell thee what to
do.&rsquo; D&#275;va angam repaired to the presence of Sri Maha Vishnu,
and represented that Param&#275;shwara had sent him, and begged to be
favoured with Vishnu&rsquo;s commands. Vishnu replied &lsquo;Do you
weave cloth to serve as a covering to the inhabitants of the
universe.&rsquo; Vishnu then gave him some of the fibres of the lotus
flower that grew from his navel, and taught him how to make it into
cloth. D&#275;va angam wove a piece of cloth, and presented it to
Vishnu, who accepted it, and ordered him to depart, and to take the
fibres of trees, and make raiment for the inhabitants of the Vishnu
loka or gods. D&#275;va angam created ten thousand weavers, who used to
go to the forest and collect the fibre of trees, and make it into cloth
for the D&#275;vatas or gods and the human race. One day, D&#275;va
angam and his tribe went to a forest in the Bhuloka or earthly world,
in order to collect the fibre of trees, when he was attacked by a race
of R&#257;kshasas or giants, on which he waxed wroth, and, unbending
his jata or long plaited hair, gave it a twist, and struck it once on
the ground. In that moment, a Shakti, or female goddess having eight
hands, each grasping a warlike weapon, sprang from the earth, attacked
the R&#257;kshasas, and defeated them. D&#275;va anga named her
Chud&#275;shwari or goddess of the hair, and, as she delivered his
tribe out of the hands of the R&#257;kshasas, he made her his tutelary
divinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tribal goddess of the D&#275;v&#257;ngas is Chaud&#275;swari, a
form of K&#257;li or Durga, who is worshipped annually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>at a
festival, in which the entire community takes part either at the
temple, or at a house or grove specially prepared for the occasion.
During the festival weaving operations cease; and those who take a
prominent part in the rites fast, and avoid pollution. The first day is
called alagu nilupadam (erecting, or fixing of the sword). The goddess
is worshipped, and a sheep or goat sacrificed, unless the settlement is
composed of vegetarian D&#275;v&#257;ngas. One man at least from each
sept fasts, remains pure, and carries a sword. Inside the temple, or at
the spot selected, the p&#363;jari (priest) tries to balance a long
sword on its point on the edge of the mouth of a pot, while the alagu
men cut their chests with the swords. Failure to balance the sword is
believed to be due to pollution brought by somebody to get rid of which
the alagu men bathe. Cow&rsquo;s urine and turmeric water are sprinkled
over those assembled, and women are kept at a distance to prevent
menstrual or other form of pollution. On the next day, called
jothi&#257;rambam (jothi, light or splendour) as Chaud&#275;swari is
believed to have sprung from jothi, a big mass is made of rice flour,
and a wick, fed with gh&#299; (clarified butter) and lighted, is placed
in a cavity scooped out therein. This flour lamp must be made by
members of a p&#363;j&#257;ri&rsquo;s family assisted sometimes by the
alagu boys. In its manufacture, a quantity of rice is steeped in water,
and poured on a plantain leaf. Jaggery (crude sugar) is then mixed with
it, and, when it is of the proper consistency, it is shaped into a
cone, and placed on a silver or brass tray. On the third day, called
p&#257;naka p&#363;ja or mah&#257;n&#275;vedyam, jaggery water is
offered, and cocoanuts, and other offerings are laid before the
goddess. The rice mass is divided up, and given to the p&#363;jari,
setti, alagu men and boys, and to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>community, to which
small portions are doled out in a particular order, which must be
strictly observed. For example, at Tindiv&#257;nam the order is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Setti (headman).</li>
<li>Dhondapu family.</li>
<li>Bapatla family.</li>
<li>Kosanam family.</li>
<li>Modanam family.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire-walking does not form part of the festival, as the goddess
herself sprang from fire.</p>
<p>In some places in the North Arcot district the festival lasts over
ten days, and varies in some points from the above. On the first day,
the people go in procession to a jammi (<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>)
tree, and worship a decorated pot (kalasam), to which sheep and goats
are sacrificed. From the second to the sixth day, the goddess and pot
are worshipped daily. On the seventh day, the jammi tree is again
visited, and a man carries on his back cooked rice, which may not be
placed on the ground, except near the tree, or at the temple. If the
rice is not set down <i>en route</i> thereto, it is accepted as a sign
that the festival may be proceeded with. Otherwise they would be afraid
to light the joti on the ninth day. This is a busy day, and the
ceremonies of sandhulu kattadam (binding the corners), alagu erecting,
lighting the flour mass, and pot worship are performed. Early in the
morning, goats and sheep are killed, outside the village boundary, in
the north, east, south, and west corners, and the blood is sprinkled on
all sides to keep off all foreign ganams or saktis. The sword business,
as already described, is gone through, and certain tests applied to see
whether the joti may be lighted. A lime fruit is placed in the region
of the navel of the idol, who should throw it down spontaneously. A
bundle of betel leaves is cut across with a knife, and the cut ends
should unite. If the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>omens are favourable, the joti is lighted,
sheep and goats are killed, and pongal (rice) is offered to the joti.
The day closes with worship of the pot. On the last day the rice mass
is distributed. All D&#275;v&#257;nga guests from other villages have
to be received and treated with respect according to the local rules,
which are in force. For this purpose, the community divide their
settlements into Sthalams, P&#257;yakattulu, Galugr&#257;matulu,
P&#275;talu, and Kurugr&#257;m&#257;lu, which have a definite order of
precedence.</p>
<p>Among the D&#275;v&#257;ngas the following endogamous sections
occur:&mdash;(1) Telugu; (2) Canarese; (3) Hathinentu Manayavaru
(eighteen house people); (4) Sivachara; (5) Ariya; (6) Kodekal
Hatakararu (weavers).</p>
<p>They are practically divided into two linguistic sections, Canarese
and Telugu, of which the former have adopted the Br&#257;hmanical
ceremonials to a greater extent than the latter, who are more
conservative. Those who wear the sacred thread seem to preponderate
over the non-thread weavers in the Canarese section. To the thread is
sometimes attached metal charm-cylinder to ward off evil spirits.</p>

<p>The majority of D&#275;v&#257;ngas are Saivites, and wear the
lingam. They do not, however, wash the stone lingam with water, in
which the feet of Jangams have been washed. They are not particular as
to always keeping the lingam on the body, and give as an explanation
that, when they are at work, they have to touch all kinds of people.
Some said that merchants, when engaged in their business, should not
wear the lingam, especially if made of spatikam (quartz), as they have
to tell untruths as regards the value and quality of their goods, and
ruin would follow if these were told while the lingam was on the
body.</p>
<p>In some parts of Ganjam, the country folk keep a large number of
Br&#257;hmini bulls. When one of these animals dies, very elaborate
funeral ceremonies take place, and the dead beast is carried in
procession by D&#275;v&#257;ngas, and buried by them. As the
D&#275;v&#257;ngas are Ling&#257;yats, they have a special reverence
for Basavanna, the sacred bull, and the burying of the Br&#257;hmini
bull is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>regarded by them as a sacred and meritorious
act. Other castes do not regard it as such, though they often set free
sacred cows or calves.</p>
<p>D&#275;v&#257;ngas and Padma S&#257;l&#275;s never live in the same
street, and do not draw water from the same well. This is probably due
to the fact that they belong to the left and right-hand factions
respectively, and no love is lost between them. Like other left-hand
castes, D&#275;v&#257;ngas have their own dancing-girls, called
J&#257;thi-biddalu (children of the castes), whose male offspring do
achchupani, printing-work on cloth, and occasionally go about begging
from D&#275;v&#257;ngas. In the Madras Census Report, 1901, it is
stated that &ldquo;in Madura and Tinnevelly, the D&#275;v&#257;ngas, or
S&#275;dans, consider themselves a shade superior to the Br&#257;hmans,
and never do namask&#257;ram (obeisance or salutation) to them, or
employ them as priests. In Madura and Coimbatore, the S&#275;dans have
their own dancing-girls, who are called D&#275;v&#257;nga or S&#275;da
D&#257;sis in the former, and M&#257;nikk&#257;tt&#257;l in the latter,
and are strictly reserved for members of the caste under pain of
excommunication or heavy fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the origin of the D&#275;v&#257;nga beggars, called
Singamv&#257;du, the following legend is current. When Chaud&#275;swari
and D&#275;v&#257;lan were engaged in combat with the Asuras, one of
the Asuras hid himself behind the ear of the lion, on which the goddess
was seated. When the fight was over, he came out, and asked for pardon.
The goddess took pity on him, and ordered that his descendants should
be called Singamv&#257;llu, and asked D&#275;v&#257;lan to treat them
as servants, and support them. D&#275;v&#257;ngas give money to these
beggars, who have the privilege of locking the door, and carrying away
the food, when the castemen take their meals. In assemblies of
D&#275;v&#257;ngas, the hand of the beggar serves <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>as a
spittoon. He conveys the news of death, and has as the insignia of
office a horn, called thuththari or singam.</p>
<p>The office of headman, or Pattagar, is hereditary, and he is
assisted by an official called Sesha-r&#257;ju or Umidisetti who is the
servant of the community, and receives a small fee annually for each
loom within his beat.</p>
<p>Widow remarriage is permitted in some places, and forbidden in
others. There may be intermarriage between the flesh-eating and
vegetarian sections. But a girl who belongs to a flesh-eating family,
and marries into a vegetarian family, must abstain from meat, and may
not touch any vessel or food in her husband&rsquo;s family till she has
reached puberty. Before settling the marriage of a girl, some village
goddess, or Chaud&#275;swari, is consulted, and the omens are watched.
A lizard chirping on the right is a good omen, and on the left bad.
Sometimes, red and white flowers, wrapped up in green leaves, are
thrown in front of the idol, and the omen considered good or bad
according to the flower which a boy or girl picks up. At the marriage
ceremony which commences with distribution of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri
(betel) and Vign&#275;swara worship, the bride is presented with a new
cloth, and sits on a three-legged stool or cloth-roller (dhonige). The
maternal uncle puts round her neck a bondhu (strings of unbleached
cotton) dipped in turmeric. The ceremonies are carried out according to
the Pur&#257;nic ritual, except by those who consider themselves to be
D&#275;v&#257;nga Br&#257;hmans. On the first day the milk post is set
up being made of <i>Odina Wodier</i> in the Tamil, and <i>Mimusops
hexandra</i> in the Telugu country. Various rites are performed, which
include tonsure, upan&#257;yanam (wearing the sacred thread),
p&#257;dap&#363;ja (washing the feet), K&#257;siy&#257;tra (mock
pilgrimage to Benares), dh&#257;r&#257;dhattam <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>(giving away the bride), and
m&#257;ngalyadh&#257;ranam (tying the marriage badge, or bottu). The
proceedings conclude with pot searching. A pap-bowl and ring are put
into a pot. If the bride picks out the bowl, her first-born will be a
girl, and if the bridegroom gets hold of the ring, it will be a boy. On
the fifth day, a square design is made on the floor with coloured rice
grains. Between the contracting couple and the square a row of lights
is placed. Four pots are set, one at each corner of the square, and
eight pots arranged along each side thereof. On the square itself, two
pots representing Siva and Uma, are placed, with a row of seedling pots
near them. A thread is wound nine times round the pots representing the
god and goddess, and tied above to the pandal. After the pots have been
worshipped, the thread is cut, and worn, with the sacred thread, for
three months. This ceremony is called N&#257;gavali.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, a twig of <i>Alangium Lamarckii</i> is
placed in the menstrual hut to keep off devils.</p>
<p>The dead are generally buried in a sitting posture. Before the grave
is filled in, a string is tied to the kudumi (hair knot) of the corpse,
and, by its means, the head is brought near the surface. Over it a
lingam is set up, and worshipped daily throughout the death
ceremonies.</p>
<p>The following curious custom is described by Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.
Once in twelve years, a D&#275;v&#257;nga leaves his home, and joins
the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s. He begs from them, saying that he is the son
of their caste, and as such entitled to be supported by them. If alms
are not forthcoming, he enters the house, and carries off whatever he
may be able to pick up. Sometimes, if he can get nothing else, he has
been known to seize a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>lighted cigar in the mouth of a
S&#257;l&#275;, and run off with it. The origin of this custom is not
certain, but it has been suggested that the D&#275;v&#257;ngas and
S&#257;l&#275;s were originally one caste, and that the former
separated from the latter when they became Ling&#257;yats. A
D&#275;v&#257;nga only becomes a Chin&#275;rig&#257;du when he is
advanced in years, and will eat the remnants of food left by Padma
S&#257;l&#275;s on their plates. A Chin&#275;rig&#257;du is, on his
death, buried by the S&#257;l&#275;s.</p>
<p>Many of the D&#275;v&#257;ngas are short of stature, light skinned,
with sharp-cut features, light-brown iris, and delicate tapering
fingers. Those at Hospet, in the Bellary district, carried thorn
tweezers (for removing thorns of <i>Acacia arabica</i> from the feet),
tooth-pick and ear-scoop, suspended as a chatelaine from the
loin-string. The more well-to-do had these articles made of silver,
with the addition of a silver saw for paring the nails and cutting
cheroots. The name Pampanna, which some of them bore, is connected with
the nymph Pampa, who resides at Hampi, and asked Param&#275;swara to
become her husband. He accordingly assumed the name of Pamp&#257;pathi,
in whose honour there is a tank at Anag&#363;ndi, and temple at Hampi.
He directed Pampa to live in a pond, and pass by the name of
Pampasarovara.</p>
<p>The S&#275;dans of Coimbatore, at the time of my visit in October,
were hard at work making clothes for the D&#299;p&#257;vali festival.
It is at times of festivals and marriages, in years of prosperity among
the people, that the weavers reap their richest harvest.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, Bilimagga (white loom) and
Atag&#257;ra (weavers and exorcists) are returned as sub-castes of
D&#275;v&#257;nga. The usual title of the D&#275;v&#257;ngas is Chetti.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=

<p>The shortness of stature of some of the weaving classes which I have
examined is brought out by the following average

<p><b>D&#275;v&#275;ndra.</b>&mdash;A name assumed by some Pallans, who
claim to be descended from the king of the gods (d&#275;vas).</p>
<p><b>Dhabba</b> (split bamboo).&mdash;Dhabba or Dhabbai is the name of
a sub-division of Koravas, who split bamboos, and make various articles
therefrom.</p>
<p><b>Dhakkado.</b>&mdash;A small mixed class of Oriya cultivators,
concerning whom there is a proverb that a Dhakkado does not know his
father. They are described, in the Census Report, 1891, as &ldquo;a
caste of cultivators found in the Jeypore agency tracts. They are said
to be the offspring of a Br&#257;hman and a S&#363;dra girl, and,
though living on the hills, they are not an uncivilised hill tribe.
Some prepare and sell the sacred thread, others are confectioners. They
wear the sacred thread, and do not drink water from the hands of any
except Br&#257;hmans. Girls are married before puberty, and widow
marriage is practiced. They are flesh-eaters, and their dead are
usually buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Dhakkados, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao writes that
&ldquo;the illegitimate descendant of a Br&#257;hman and a hill woman
of the non-polluting castes is said to be known as a Dhakkado. The
Dhakkados assume Br&#257;hmanical names, but, as regards marriages,
funerals, etc., follow the customs of their mother&rsquo;s caste. Her
caste people intermarry with her children. A <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>Dhakkado usually follows the occupation of his
mother&rsquo;s caste. Thus one whose mother is a Kevuto follows the
calling of fishing or plying boats on rivers, one whose mother is a
Bhumia is an agriculturist, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Dhak&#363;r.</b>&mdash;Stated, in the Manual of the Vizagapatam
district, to be illegitimate children of Br&#257;hmans, who wear the
paieta (sacred thread).</p>
<p><b>Dhanap&#257;la.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Gollas, who guard
treasure while it is in transit.</p>
<p><b>Dhangar.</b>&mdash;Dhangar, or Donigar, is recorded, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as a Mar&#257;thi caste of shepherds and
cattle-breeders. I gather, from a note<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3253src" href="#xd21e3253" name="xd21e3253src">45</a> on the
Dhangars of the Kanara district in the Bombay Presidency, that
&ldquo;the word Dhangar is generally derived from the Sanskrit dhenu, a
cow. Their home speech is Mar&#257;thi, but they can speak Kanarese.
They keep a special breed of cows and buffaloes, known as Dhangar
mhasis and Dhangar g&#257;is which are the largest cattle in Kanara.
Many of Shiv&#257;ji&rsquo;s infantry were S&#257;t&#257;ra
Dhangars.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Dhani&#257;la</b> (coriander).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kamma.
Dhani&#257;la J&#257;ti, or coriander caste, is an opprobrious name
applied to K&#333;matis, indicating that, in business transactions,
they must be crushed as coriander fruits are crushed before the seed is
sown.</p>
<p><b>Dh&#257;re.</b>&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba. In the Canara
country, the essential and binding part of the marriage ceremony is
called dh&#257;re (<i>see</i> Bant).</p>
<p><b>Dharmar&#257;ja.</b>&mdash;An exogamous sept of the Irulas of
North Arcot. Dharmar&#257;ja was the eldest of the five P&#257;ndavas,
the heroes of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;ratha. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p><b>Dhippo</b> (light).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Bhond&#257;ri. The
members thereof may not blow out lights, or extinguish them in any
other way. They will not light lamps without being madi, <i>i.e.</i>,
wearing silk cloths, or cloths washed and dried after bathing.</p>
<p><b>Dh&#333;bi.</b>&mdash;A name used for washerman by Anglo-Indians
all over India. The word is said to be derived from dh&#333;ha,
Sanskrit, dh&#257;v, to wash. A whitish grey sandy efflorescence, found
in many places, from which, by boiling and the addition of quicklime,
an alkali of considerable strength is obtained, is called
Dh&#333;bi&rsquo;s earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3283src" href=

"#xd21e3286" name="xd21e3286src">47</a> &ldquo;although applied to any
itching ringworm-like affection of any part of the skin, most commonly
refers to some form of epiphytic disease of the crutch or axilla
(armpit).&rdquo; The disease is very generally supposed to be
communicated by clothes from the wash, but Manson is of opinion that
the belief that it is contracted from clothes which have been
contaminated by the washerman is probably not very well founded.</p>
<p>Dh&#333;bi is the name, by which the washerman caste of the Oriyas
is known. &ldquo;They are said,&rdquo; Mr. Francis writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3291src" href="#xd21e3291" name=
"xd21e3291src">48</a> &ldquo;to have come originally from Orissa. Girls
are generally married before maturity, and, if this is not possible,
they have to be married to a sword or a tree, before they can be wedded
to a man. Their ordinary marriage ceremonies are as follows. The bridal
pair bathe in water brought from seven different houses. The bridegroom
puts a bangle on the bride&rsquo;s arm (this is the binding part of the
ceremony); the left and right wrists of the bride and bridegroom are
tied together; betel leaf and nut are tied in a corner of the
bride&rsquo;s cloth, and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=
"#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>myrabolam (<i>Terminalia</i>
fruit) in that of the bridegroom; and finally the people present in the
pandal (booth) throw rice and saffron (turmeric) over them. Widows and
divorced women may marry again. They are Vaishnavites, but some of them
also worship K&#257;li or Durga. They employ Bair&#257;gis, and
occasionally Br&#257;hmans, as their priests. They burn their dead, and
perform sr&#257;ddha (annual memorial ceremony). Their titles are
Chetti (or Mah&#257; Chetti) and B&#275;hara.&rdquo; The custom of the
bridal pair bathing in water from seven different houses obtains among
many Oriya castes, including Br&#257;hmans. It is known by the name of
p&#257;ni-tula. The water is brought by married girls, who have not
reached puberty, on the night preceding the wedding day, and the bride
and bridegroom wash in it before dawn. This bath is called koili
p&#257;ni sn&#257;no, or cuckoo water-bath. The koil is the Indian koel
or cuckoo (<i>Eudynamis honorata</i>), whose crescendo cry ku-il,
ku-il, is trying to the nerves during the hot season.</p>
<p>The following proverbs<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3304src" href=
"#xd21e3304" name="xd21e3304src">49</a> relating to washermen may be
quoted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Get a new washerman, and an old barber.</p>
<p>The washerman knows the defects of the village (<i>i.e.</i>, he
learns a good deal about the private affairs of the various families,
when receiving and delivering the clothes).</p>
<p>When a washerman gets sick, his sickness must leave him at the
stone. The stone referred to is the large stone, on which the washerman
cleans cloths, and the proverb denotes that, however sick a washerman
may be, his work must be done.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Dhoddi.</b>&mdash;Dhoddi, meaning a court or back-yard,
cattle-pen, or sheep-fold, has been recorded as an exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga, Koppala Velama, Kama S&#257;l&#275;, M&#257;la, and
Y&#257;n&#257;di. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"

<p><b>Dhoddiyan.</b>&mdash;A name given by Tamilians to J&#333;gis.</p>
<p><b>Dhollo.</b>&mdash;Dhollo is recorded in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as the same as Doluva. A correspondent informs me that Dhollo is
said to be different from Doluva.</p>
<p><b>Dh&#333;ma</b> (gnat or mosquito).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
M&#257;la.</p>
<p><b>Dhondapu</b> (<i>Cephalandra indica</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept
of D&#275;v&#257;nga. The fruit is one of the commonest of native
vegetables, and cooked in curries.</p>
<p><b>Dh&#333;ni</b> (boat).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#299;la and
Oruganti K&#257;pu. In a paper on the native vessels of South India by
Mr. Edge, published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, the
dh&#333;ni is described as &ldquo;a vessel of ark-like form, about 70
feet long, 20 feet broad, and 11 feet deep, with a flat bottom or keel
part, which at the broadest place is 7 feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole equipment of these rude vessels, as well as their
construction, is the most coarse and unseaworthy that I have ever
seen.&rdquo; The dh&#333;ni, with masts, is represented in the ancient
lead and copper coinage of Southern India.</p>
<p><b>Dhor.</b>&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1901, a few (164)
individuals were returned as &ldquo;Dh&#275;r, a low caste of
Mar&#257;thi leather workers.&rdquo; They were, I gather from the
Bombay Gazetteer, Dhors or tanners who dwell in various parts of the
Bombay Presidency, and whose home speech, names and surnames seem to
show that they have come from the Mar&#257;tha country.</p>
<p><b>Dh&#363;dala</b> (calves).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Th&#363;mati Golla.</p>
<p><b>Dhudho</b> (milk).&mdash;A sept of Omanaito.</p>

<p><b>Dh&#363;liya.</b>&mdash;Dh&#363;liya or D&#363;lia is a small
class of Oriya cultivators, some of whom wear the sacred thread, and
employ Boishnobs as their priests. Marriage before puberty is not
compulsory, and widows can remarry. They eat flesh. The dead are
cremated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3371src" href="#xd21e3371" name=
"xd21e3371src">50</a> The name is said to be derived from dhuli, dust,
with which those who work in the fields are covered. Dh&#363;liya also
means carriers of dhulis (dhoolies), which are a form of palanquin.</p>
<p><b>Did&#257;vi.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Poroja.</p>
<p><b>Digambara</b> (space-clad or sky-clad, <i>i.e.</i>,
nude).&mdash;One of the two main divisions of the Jains. The Digambaras
are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3385src" href="#xd21e3385" name=
"xd21e3385src">51</a> to &ldquo;regard absolute nudity as the
indispensable sign of holiness, though the advance of civilisation has
compelled them to depart from the practice of their theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>D&#299;var.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> D&#275;va.</p>
<p><b>Diy&#257;si.</b>&mdash;An exogamous sept of Dand&#257;si. The
members thereof show special reverence for the sun, and cloths,
mokkutos (forehead chaplets), garlands, and other articles to be used
by the bride and bridegroom at a wedding are placed outside the house,
so that they may be exposed to it.</p>
<p><b>Dolaiya.</b>&mdash;A title of Doluva and Odia.</p>
<p><b>Dolob&#275;hara.</b>&mdash;The name of headmen or their
assistants among many Oriya castes. In some cases, <i>e.g.</i>, among
the Haddis, the name is used as a title by families, members of which
are headmen.</p>
<p><b>Doluva.</b>&mdash;The Doluvas of Ganjam are, according to the
Madras Census Report, 1891, &ldquo;supposed to be the descendants of
the old R&#257;jahs by their concubines, and were employed as soldiers
and attendants. The name is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>said to be derived from the
Sanskrit dola, meaning army.&rdquo; The Doluvas claim to be descended
from the Puri R&#257;jahs by their concubines, and say that some of
them were employed as sirdars and paiks under these R&#257;jahs. They
are said to have accompanied a certain Puri R&#257;jah who came south
to wage war, and to have settled in Ganjam. They are at the present day
mainly engaged in agriculture, though some are traders, bricklayers,
cart-drivers, etc. The caste seems to be divided into five sections,
named Kondaiyito, Lenka, Rabba, Pottia, and Beharania, of which the
first two are numerically the strongest and most widely distributed.
Kondaiyito is said to be derived from kondo, an arrow, and to indicate
warrior. The Kondaiyitos sometimes style themselves R&#257;jah Doluvas,
and claim superiority over the other sections. It is noted, in the
Madras Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;Oriya Zamindars get wives from
this sub-division, but the men of it cannot marry into the
Zamindar&rsquo;s families. They wear the sacred thread, and are
writers.&rdquo; In former days, the title writer was applied to the
junior grade of Civil Servants of the East India Company. It is now
used to denote a copying clerk in an office.</p>
<p>Various titles occur among members of the caste, <i>e.g.</i>,
Bissoyi, Bisw&#257;lo, Dolei, Jenna, Kottiya, Mahanti, Majhi,
N&#257;hako, Porida, R&#257;vuto, S&#257;mulo, and S&#257;ni.</p>
<p>The ordinary caste council system, with a hereditary headman, seems
to be absent among the Doluvas, and the affairs of the caste are
settled by leading members thereof.</p>
<p>The Doluvas are Paramarthos, following the Chaitanya form of
Vaishnavism, and wearing a rosary of tulsi (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>)
beads. They further worship various T&#257;kur&#257;nis (village
deities), among which are K&#257;lva, B&#257;gad&#275;vi, Kotari,
Mah&#275;swari, and Manick&#275;swari. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>are
in some places very particular regarding the performance of sr&#257;dh
(memorial ceremony), which is carried out annually in the following
manner. On the night before the sr&#257;dh day, a room is prepared for
the reception of the soul of the deceased. This room is called pitru
bharano (reception of the ancestor). The floor thereof is cleansed with
cow-dung water, and a lamp fed with gh&#299; (clarified butter) is
placed on it by the side of a plank. On this plank a new cloth is laid
for the reception of various articles for worship, <i>e.g.</i>, sacred
grass, <i>Zizyphus jujuba</i> leaves, flowers, etc. In front of the
plank a brass vessel, containing water and a tooth brush of
<i>Achyranthes aspera</i> root, is placed. The dead person&rsquo;s son
throws rice and <i>Zizyphus</i> leaves into the air, and calls on the
deceased to come and give a blessing on the following day. The room is
then locked, and the lamp kept burning in it throughout the night. On
the following day, all old pots are thrown away and, after a small
space has been cleaned on the floor of the house, a pattern is drawn
thereon with flour in the form of a square or oblong with twelve
divisions. On each division a jak (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) leaf
is placed, and on each leaf the son puts cooked rice and vegetables. A
vessel containing <i>Achyranthes</i> root, and a plank with a new cloth
on it, are set by the side of the pattern. After worship has been
performed and food offered, the cloth is presented to a Br&#257;hman,
and the various articles used in the ceremonial are thrown into
water.</p>
<p><b>D&#333;mb.</b>&mdash;The name D&#333;mb or D&#333;mbo is said to
be derived from the word dumba, meaning devil, in reference to the
thieving propensities of the tribe. The D&#333;mbas, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3454src" href="#xd21e3454" name=
"xd21e3454src">52</a> &ldquo;are a Dravidian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>caste of weavers and menials, found in the hill
tracts of Vizagapatam. This caste appears to be an offshoot of the
D&#333;m caste of Bengal, Beh&#257;r, and the North-Western Provinces.
Like the D&#333;ms, the D&#333;mbas are regarded with disgust, because
they eat beef, pork, horse-flesh, rats, and the flesh of animals which
have died a natural death, and both are considered to be Chand&#257;las
or Pariahs by the Beng&#257;lis and the Uriyas. The D&#333;mbs weave
the cloths and blankets worn by the hill people, but, like the Pariahs
of the plains, they are also labourers, scavengers, etc. Some of them
are extensively engaged in trade, and they have, as a rule, more
knowledge of the world than the ryots who despise them. They are great
drunkards.&rdquo; In the Census Report, 1871, it was noted that
&ldquo;in many villages, the D&#333;ms carry on the occupation of
weaving, but, in and around Jaipur, they are employed as horse-keepers,
tom-tom beaters, scavengers, and in other menial duties.
Notwithstanding their abject position in the social scale, some signs
of progress may be detected amongst them. They are assuming the
occupation, in many instances, of petty hucksters, eking out a
livelihood by taking advantage of the small difference in rates between
market and market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The D&#333;mbs,&rdquo; Mr. F. Fawcett writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3461src" href="#xd21e3461" name=
"xd21e3461src">53</a> &ldquo;are an outcast jungle people, who inhabit
the forests on the high lands fifty to eighty or a hundred miles from
the east coast, about Vizagapatam. Being outcast, they are never
allowed to live within a village, but have their own little hamlet
adjoining a village proper, inhabited by people of various superior
castes. It is fair to say that the D&#333;mbs are akin to the
P&#257;nos of the adjoining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>Khond country, a Pariah folk who
live amongst the Khonds, and used to supply the human victims for the
Meriah sacrifices. Indeed, the Khonds, who hold them in contemptuous
inferiority, call them D&#333;mbas as a sort of alternative title to
P&#257;nos. The Paidis of the adjoining Savara or Saora country are
also, doubtless, kinsmen of the D&#333;mbs. [The same man is said to be
called Paidi by Telugus, D&#333;mbo by the Savaras, and P&#257;no by
the Khonds. It is noted in the Census Report, 1881, that the P&#257;no
quarters in Khond villages are called D&#333;mbo Sai.] In most respects
their condition is a very poor one. Though they live in the best part
of the Presidency for game, they know absolutely nothing of hunting,
and cannot even handle a bow and arrow. They have, however, one
respectable quality, industry, and are the weavers, traders, and
money-lenders of the hills, being very useful as middlemen between the
Khonds, Sauras, Gadabas, and other hill people on the one hand, and the
traders of the plains on the other. I am informed, on good authority,
that there are some D&#333;mbs who rise higher than this, but cannot
say whether these are, or are not crosses with superior races. Most
likely they are, for most of the D&#333;mbs are arrant thieves. It was
this propensity for thieving, in fact, which had landed some hundreds
of them in the jail at Vizagapatam when I visited that place, and gave
me an opportunity of recording their measurements.&rdquo; The averages
of the more important of these measurements are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is noted by the Missionary Gloyer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3501src" href="#xd21e3501" name="xd21e3501src">54</a> that the
colour of the skin of the D&#333;mbs varies from very dark to yellow,
and their height from that of an Aryan to the short stature of an
aboriginal, and that there is a corresponding variation in facial
type.</p>
<p>For the following note on the D&#333;mbs, I am indebted to Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao. They are the weavers, traders, musicians, beggars, and
money-lenders of the hills. Some own cattle, and cultivate. The hill
people in the interior are entirely dependent on them for their
clothing. A few D&#333;mb families are generally found to each village.
They act as middlemen between the hill people and the K&#333;mati
traders. Their profits are said to be large, and their children are, in
some places, found attending hill schools. As musicians, they play on
the drum and pipe. They are the hereditary musicians of the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Jeypore. A D&#333;mb beggar, when engaged in his
professional calling, goes about from door to door, playing on a little
pipe. Their supposed powers over devils and witches result in their
being consulted when troubles appear. Though the D&#333;mbs are
regarded as a low and polluting class, they will not eat at the hands
of K&#333;matis, Bhond&#257;ris, or Gh&#257;sis. Some D&#333;mbas have
become converts to Christianity through missionary influence.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the following sections of the
D&#333;mbs are recorded:&mdash;Onomia, Odia, M&#257;ndiri, Mirg&#257;m,
and Kohara. The sub-divisions, however, seem to be as
follows:&mdash;Mirig&#257;ni, Kobbiriya, Odiya, S&#333;dabisiya,
M&#257;ndiri, and Andiniya. There are also various septs, of which the
following have been recorded among the Odiyas:&mdash;Bh&#257;g (tiger),
B&#257;lu (bear), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span>N&#257;g (cobra), Hanum&#257;n (the monkey
god), Kochchipo (tortoise), Bengri (frog), Kukra (dog), Surya (sun),
Matsya (fish), and Jaikonda (lizard). It is noted by Mr. Fawcett that
&ldquo;monkeys, frogs, and cobras are taboo, and also the sun&#257;ri
tree (<i>Ochna squarrosa</i>). The big lizard, cobras, frogs, and the
crabs which are found in the paddy fields, and are usually eaten by
jungle people, may not be eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she remains outside the hut for five
days, and then bathes at the nearest stream, and is presented with a
new cloth. In honour of the event, drink is distributed among her
relatives. Girls are usually married after puberty. A man can claim his
paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. When a proposal of marriage
is to be made, the suitor carries some pots of liquor, usually worth
two rupees, to the girl&rsquo;s house, and deposits them in front of
it. If her parents consent to the match, they take the pots inside, and
drink some of the liquor. After some time has elapsed, more liquor,
worth five rupees, is taken to the girl&rsquo;s house. A reduction in
the quantity of liquor is made when a man is proposing for the hand of
his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, and, on the second occasion, the
liquor will only be worth three rupees. A similar reduction is made in
the jholla tonka, or bride price. On the wedding day, the bridegroom
goes, accompanied by his relations, to the bride&rsquo;s home, where,
at the auspicious moment fixed by the Des&#257;ri, his father presents
new cloths to himself and the bride, which they put on. They stand
before the hut, and on each is placed a cloth with a myrabolam
(<i>Terminalia</i>) seed, rice, and a few copper coins tied up in it.
The bridegroom&rsquo;s right little finger is linked with the left
little finger of the bride, and they enter the hut. On the following
day, the newly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>married couple repair to the home of the
bridegroom. On the third day, they are bathed in turmeric water, a pig
is killed, and a feast is held. On the ninth day, the knots in the
cloths, containing the myrabolams, rice, and coins, are untied, and the
marriage ceremonies are at an end. The remarriage of widows is
permitted, and a younger brother usually marries the widow of his elder
brother.</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;some of the D&#333;mbus of the Parvatipur Agency follow many of
the customs of the low-country castes, including m&#275;narikam
(marriage with the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter), and say they are
the same as the Paidis (or Paidi M&#257;las) of the plains adjoining,
with whom they intermarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corpses of the more prosperous D&#333;mbs are usually cremated.
The wood of the sun&#257;ri tree and relli (<i>Cassia fistula</i>) may
not be used for the pyre. The son or husband of a deceased person has
his head, moustache, and armpits shaved on the tenth day.</p>
<p>D&#333;mb women, and women of other tribes in the Jeypore Agency
tracts, wear silver ear ornaments called n&#257;gul, representing a
cobra just about to strike with tongue protruded. Similar ornaments of
gold, called n&#257;ga p&#333;gulu (cobra-shaped earrings), are worn by
women of some Telugu castes in the plains of Vizagapatam.</p>
<p>The personal names of the D&#333;mbs are, as among other Oriya
castes, often those of the day of the week on which the individual was
born.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the D&#333;mbs, Mr. Fawcett notes that
&ldquo;their chief god&mdash;probably an ancestral spirit&mdash;is
called Kaluga. There is one in each village, in the headman&rsquo;s
house. The deity is represented by a pie piece (copper coin), placed in
or over a new earthen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>pot smeared with rice and turmeric
powder. During worship, a silk cloth, a new cloth, or a wet cloth may
be worn, but one must not dress in leaves. Before the mangoes are
eaten, the first-fruits are offered to the moon, at the full moon of
the month Chitra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; Gloyer writes, &ldquo;a house has to be built,
the first thing is to select a favourable spot, to which few evil
spirits (d&#363;mas) resort. At this spot they put, in several places,
three grains of rice arranged in such a way that the two lower grains
support the upper one. To protect the grains, they pile up stones round
them, and the whole is lightly covered with earth. When, after some
time, they find on inspection that the upper grain has fallen off, the
spot is regarded as unlucky, and must not be used. If the position of
the grains remains unchanged, the omen is regarded as auspicious. They
drive in the first post, which must have a certain length, say of five,
seven, or nine ells, the ell being measured from the tip of the middle
finger to the elbow. The post is covered on the top with rice straw,
leaves, and shrubs, so that birds may not foul it, which would be
regarded as an evil omen. [In Madras, a story is current, with
reference to the statue of Sir Thomas Munro, that he seized upon all
the rice dep&ocirc;ts, and starved the people to death by selling rice
in egg-shells at one shell for a rupee, and, to punish him, the
Government erected the statue in an open place, so that the birds of
the air might insult him by polluting his face.] In measuring the
house, odd numbers play an important part. The number four (pura, or
full number), however, forms the proper measurement, whereby they
measure the size of the house, according to the pleasure of the
builder. But now the Dissary (D&#275;s&#257;ri) decides whether the
house shall be built on the nandi, dua, or tia system, nandi
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>signifying one, dua two, and tia three. This
number of ells must be added to the measurement of the house. Supposing
that the length of the house is twelve ells, then it will be necessary
to add one ell according to the nandi system, so that the length
amounts to thirteen ells. The number four can only be used for
stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The D&#363;mas,&rdquo; Gloyer continues, &ldquo;are
represented as souls of the deceased, which roam about without a home,
so as to cause to mankind all possible harm. At the birth of a child,
the D&#363;ma must be invited in a friendly manner to provide the child
with a soul, and protect it against evil. For this purpose, a fowl is
killed on the ninth day, a bone (beinknochen) detached, and pressed in
to the hand of the infant. The relations are seated in solemn silence,
and utter the formula:&mdash;When grandfather, grandmother, father, or
brother comes, throw away the bone, and we will truly believe it. No
sooner does the sprawling and excited infant drop the bone, than the
D&#363;mas are come, and boisterous glee prevails. The D&#363;mas
occasionally give vent to their ghostly sounds, and cause no little
consternation among the inmates of a house, who hide from fear. Cunning
thieves know how to rob the superstitious by employing instruments with
a subdued tone (dumpft&ouml;nende), or by emitting deep sounds from the
chest. The yearly sacrifice to a D&#363;ma consists of a black fowl and
strong brandy. If a member of a family falls ill, an extraordinary
sacrifice has to be offered up. The D&#363;ma is not regarded only as
an evil spirit, but also as a tutelary deity. He protects one against
the treacherous attacks of witches. A place is prepared for him in the
door-hinge, or a fishing-net, wherein he lives, is placed over the
door. The witches must count all the knots of the net, before they can
enter. Devil worship is closely connected with that of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>D&#363;ma. The devil&rsquo;s priests, and in
rare cases priestesses, effect communion between the people and the
D&#363;mas by a sort of possession, which the spirit, entering into
them, is said to give rise to. This condition, which is produced by
intoxicating drink and the fumes of burning incense, gives rise to
revolting cramp-like contortions, and muscular quiverings. In this
state, they are wont to communicate what sacrifices the spirits
require. On special occasions, they fall into a frenzied state, in
which they cut their flesh with sharp instruments, or pass long, thin
iron bars through the tongue and cheeks, during which operation no
blood must flow. For this purpose, the instruments are rubbed all over
with some blood-congealing material or sap. They also affect sitting on
a sacred swing, armed with long iron nails. [Mr. G. F. Paddison informs
me that he once saw a villager in the Vizagapatam district, sitting
outside the house, while groans proceeded from within. He explained
that he was ill, and his wife was swinging on nails with their points
upwards, to cure him.] The devil called Jom Duto, or messenger of the
going, is believed to be a one-eyed, limping, black individual, whose
hair is twisted into a frightfully long horn, while one foot is very
long, and the other resembles the hoof of a buffalo. He makes his
appearance at the death-bed, in order to drag his victim to the realm
of torture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children are supposed to be born without souls, and to be afterwards
chosen as an abode by the soul of an ancestor. The coming of the
ancestor is signalised by the child dropping a chicken bone which has
been thrust into its hand, and much rejoicing follows among the
assembled relations.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3546src" href=

<p>Mr. Paddison tells me that some D&#333;mbs are reputed to be able to
pour blazing oil over their bodies, without suffering any hurt; and one
man is said to have had a miraculous power of hardening his skin, so
that any one could have a free shot at him, without hurting him. He
further narrates that, at Sujanak&#333;ta in the Vizagapatam district,
the D&#333;mbs, notwithstanding frequent warnings, put devils into two
successive schoolmasters.</p>
<p>Various tattoo devices, borne by the D&#333;mbs examined by Mr.
Fawcett, are figured and described by him. &ldquo;These
patterns,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;were said to be, one and all, purely
ornamental, and not in any way connected with totems, or tribal
emblems.&rdquo; Risley, however,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3554src"
href="#xd21e3554" name="xd21e3554src">56</a> regards &ldquo;four out of
the twelve designs as pretty closely related to the religion and
mythology of the tribe; two are totems and two have reference to the
traditional avocations. Nos. 11 and 12 represent a classical scene in
D&#333;m folk-lore, the story of King Haris-Chandra, who was so
generous that he gave all he had to the poor and sold himself to a
D&#333;m at Benares, who employed him to watch his cremation ground at
night. While he was thus engaged, his wife, who had also been sold for
charitable purposes, came to burn the body of her son. She had no money
to pay her fees, and Haris-Chandra, not knowing her in the darkness,
turned her away. Fortunately the sun rose; mutual recognition followed;
the victims of promiscuous largesse were at once remarried, and Vishnu
intervened to restore the son to life. Tatu No. 11 shows Haris-Chandra
watching the burning-ground by moonlight; the wavy line is the Ganges;
the dots are the trees on the other side; the strokes on either side of
the king are the logs of wood, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183"
href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>which he is guarding. In No.
12 we see the sun rising, its first ray marked with a sort of fork, and
the meeting of the king and queen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3560width"><img src="images/fig2-183.png" alt=

<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;throughout the Jeypore country proper, the Dombus (and some
Gh&#257;sis) are by far the most troublesome class. Their favourite
crime is cattle-theft for the sake of the skins, but, in 1902, a Dombu
gang in Naurangp&#363;r went so far as to levy blackmail over a large
extent of country, and defy for some months all attempts at capture.
The loss of their cattle exasperates the other hill folk to the last
degree, and, in 1899, the Naiks (headmen) of sixteen villages in the
north of Jeypore t&#257;luk headed an organized attack on the houses of
the Dombus, which, in the most deliberate manner, they razed to the
ground in some fifteen villages. The Dombus had fortunately got scent
of what was coming, and made themselves scarce, and no bloodshed
occurred. In the next year, some of the Naiks of the R&#257;magiri side
of Jeypore t&#257;luk sent round a jack branch, a well-recognised form
of the fiery cross, summoning villagers other than Dombus to assemble
at a fixed time and place, but this was luckily intercepted by the
police. The Agent afterwards discussed the whole question with the
chief Naiks of Jeypore and South Naurangp&#363;r. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>had
no opinion of the deterrent effects of mere imprisonment on the Dombus.
&lsquo;You fatten them, and send them back,&rsquo; they said, and
suggested that a far better plan would be to cut off their right hands.
[It is noted, in the Vizagapatam Manual, 1869, that in cases of murder,
the R&#257;jah of Jeypore generally had the man&rsquo;s hands, nose,
and ears cut off, but, after all that, he seldom escaped the
deceased&rsquo;s relatives.] They eventually proposed a plan of
checking the cattle-thefts, which is now being followed in much of that
country. The B&#257;ranaiks, or heads of groups of villages, were each
given brands with distinctive letters and numbers, and required to
brand the skins of all animals which had died a natural death or been
honestly killed; and the possession by Dombus, skin merchants, or
others, of unbranded skins is now considered a suspicious circumstance,
the burden of explaining which lies upon the possessor. Unless this, or
some other way of checking the Dombus&rsquo; depredations proves
successful, serious danger exists that the rest of the people will take
the matter into their own hands and, as the Dombus in the Agency number
over 50,000, this would mean real trouble.&rdquo; It is further
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3566src" href="#xd21e3566" name=
"xd21e3566src">57</a> that the Paidis (Paidi M&#257;las), who often
commit dacoities on the roads, &ldquo;are connected with the Dombus of
the R&#257;yagada and Gunupur t&#257;luks, who are even worse. These
people dacoit houses at night in armed gangs of fifty or more, with
their faces blacked to prevent recognition. Terrifying the villagers
into staying quiet in their huts, they force their way into the house
of some wealthy person (for choice the local Sondi, liquor-seller and
sowcar,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3570src" href="#xd21e3570" name=
"xd21e3570src">58</a> usually the only man worth looting in an agency
village, and a shark who gets little pity from his <span class=

men, rape the women, and go off with everything of value. Their
favourite method of extracting information regarding concealed property
is to sprinkle the houseowner with boiling oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Dommara.</b>&mdash;The Dommaras are a tribe of tumblers,
athletes, and mountebanks, some of whom wander about the country, while
others have settled down as agricultural labourers, or make combs out
of the wood of <i>El&aelig;odendron glaucum</i>, <i>Ixora
parviflora</i>, <i>Pavetta indica</i>, <i>Ficus bengalensis</i>, etc.,
which they sell to wholesale merchants. They are, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3591src" href="#xd21e3591" name=
"xd21e3591src">59</a> &ldquo;a nomad class of acrobats, who, in many
respects, recall the gipsies to mind, and raise the suggestion that
their name may possibly be connected with the D&#333;ms of Northern
India. They speak Telugu, Mar&#257;thi, and Hindustani, but not
generally Tamil. They are skilful jugglers, and both men and women are
very clever tumblers and tight-rope dancers, exhibiting their feats as
they travel about the country. Some of them sell date mats and baskets,
some trade in pigs, while others, settled in villages, cultivate lands.
In social position they rank just above the Pariahs and M&#257;digas.
They profess to be Vaishnavites [and Saivites]. Infant marriage is not
practiced. Widow remarriage is freely allowed, and polygamy is common.
Their marriage tie is very loose, and their women often practice
prostitution. They are a predatory class, great drunkards, and of most
dissolute habits. The dead are generally buried, and [on the day of the
final death ceremonies] cooked rice is thrown out to be eaten by crows.
In the matter of food, they eat all sorts of animals, including pigs,
cats, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>crows.&rdquo; When a friend was engaged in
making experiments in connection with snake venom, some Dommaras asked
for permission to unbury the corpses of snakes and mungooses for the
purpose of food.</p>

</div>
<p>The Dommaras are, in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, summed up as
being buffoons, tumblers, acrobats, and snakecharmers, who travel from
place to place, and earn a precarious living by their exhibitions. In
the Madras Census Report, 1901, Domban, Kalaik&#363;tt&#257;di
(pole-dancer), and &#256;rya K&#363;tt&#257;di, are given as synonyms
of Dommara. The K&#363;tt&#257;di are summed up, in the Tanjore Manual,
as vagabond dancers, actors, pantomimists, and marionette exhibitors,
who hold a very low position in the social scale, and always perform in
public streets and bazaars.</p>
<p>By Mr. F. S. Mullaly<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3606src" href=
"#xd21e3606" name="xd21e3606src">60</a> the Dommaras are divided into
Reddi or K&#257;pu (<i>i.e.</i>, cultivators) and &#256;ray
(Mar&#257;tha). &ldquo;The women,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;are
proficient in making combs of horn and wood, and implements used by
weavers. These they hawk about from place to place, to supplement the
profits they derive from their exhibitions of gymnastic feats. In
addition to performing conjuring tricks, rope-dancing and the like, the
Dommaras hunt, fish, make mats, and rear donkeys and pigs. The head of
the tribe is called the Mutli Guru. He is their high priest, and
exercises supreme jurisdiction over them both in spiritual and temporal
matters. His head-quarters is Chitv&#275;l in the Cuddapah district.
The legend regarding the office of the Mutli Guru is as follows. At
Chitv&#275;l, or as it was then known Mutli, there once lived a king,
who called together a gathering of all the gymnasts among his subjects.
Several classes were represented. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>P&#333;l&#275;rig&#257;du, a
Reddi Dommara, so pleased the king that he was presented with a ring,
and a royal edict was passed that the wearer of the ring and his
descendants should be the head of the Dommara class. The ring then
given is said to be the same that is now worn by the head of the tribe
at Chitv&#275;l, which bears an inscription in Telugu declaring that
the wearer is the high-priest or guru of all the Dommaras. The office
is hereditary. The dwellings of the Dommaras are somewhat similar to
those of the Koravars and Joghis, made of palmyra leaves plaited into
mats with seven strands. These huts, or gudisays, are located on the
outskirts of villages, and carried on the backs of donkeys when on the
march. Stolen cloths, unless of value, are not as a rule sold, but
concealed in the packs of their donkeys, and after a time worn. The
Dommaras are addicted to dacoity, robbery, burglary, and thefts. The
instrument used by them is unlike those used by other criminal classes:
it is of iron, about a foot long, and with a chisel-shaped point. As
cattle and sheep lifters they are expert, and they have their regular
receivers at most of the cattle fairs throughout the
Presidency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Nellore Manual, that the Dommaras &ldquo;are
stated by the Nellore Tahsildar to possess mir&#257;si rights in some
villages; that I take to mean that there is, in some villages, a
customary contribution for tumblers and mendicants, which, according to
Wilson, was made in Mysore the pretext for a tax named
Dombar-lingada-vira-kaniki. This tax, under the name Dombar tafrik, was
levied in Venkatagiri in 1801.&rdquo; In the Madura district, Dommaras
are found in some villages formerly owned by zamindars, and they call
themselves children of the zamindars, by whom they were probably
patronised. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>Being a criminal class, the Dommaras have a thief&rsquo;s language
of their own, of which the following are examples:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bidam vadu, Dommara.</li>
<li>Poothi, policeman.</li>
<li>Marigam, pig.</li>
<li>Goparam, seven.</li>
<li>D&#257;sa-masa, prostitute.</li>
<li>Kopparam, salt.</li>
<li>Kaljodu, goldsmith.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dommaras are said to receive into their community children of
other castes, and women of doubtful morals, and to practice the custom
of making Basavis (dedicated prostitutes).</p>
<p>The Telugu Dommaras give as their g&#333;tra Salava patchi, the name
of a mythological bird. At times of marriage, they substitute a
turmeric-dyed string consisting of 101 threads, called bondhu, for the
golden t&#257;li or bottu. The marriage ceremonies of the &#256;r&#275;
Dommaras are supervised by an old Basavi woman, and the golden marriage
badge is tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck by a Basavi.</p>

</div>
<p>A Dommara, whom I interviewed at Coimbatore, carried a cotton bag
containing a miscellaneous assortment of rubbish used in his capacity
as medicine man and snake-charmer, which included a collection of
spurious jackal horns (nari kompu), the hairs round which were stained
with turmeric. To prove the genuineness thereof, he showed me not only
the horn, but also the feet with nails complete, as evidence that the
horns were not made from the nails. Being charged with manufacturing
the horns, he swore, by placing his hand on the head of a child who
accompanied him, that he was not deceiving me. The largest of the horns
in his bag, he gravely informed me, was from a jackal which he dug out
of its hole on the last new moon night. The possessors of such horns,
he assured me, do not go out with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>pack, and rarely
leave their holes except to feed on dew, field rats, etc. These
spurious horns are regarded as a talisman, and it is believed that he
who owns one can command the realisation of every wish. (<i>See</i>
Kuruvikk&#257;ran.) An iron ring, which the Dommara was wearing on his
wrist, was used as a cure for hernia, being heated and applied as a
branding agent over the inguinal region. Lamp oil is then rubbed over
the burn, and a secret medicine, mixed with fowl&rsquo;s egg,
administered. The ring was, he said, an ancestral heir-loom, and as
such highly prized. To cure rheumatism in the big joints, he resorted
to an ingenious form of dry cupping. A small incision is made with a
piece of broken glass over the affected part, and the skin damped with
water. The distal end of a cow&rsquo;s horn, of which the tip has been
removed, and plugged with wax, does duty for the cup. A hole is pierced
through the wax with an iron needle, and, the horn being placed over
the seat of disease, the air is withdrawn from it by suction with the
mouth, and the hole in the wax stopped up. As the air is removed from
the cavity of the horn, the skin rises up within it. To remove the
horn, it is only necessary to readmit air by once more boring a hole
through the wax. In a bad case, as many as three horns may be applied
to the affected part. The Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford possesses
dry-cupping apparatus, made of cow horn, from Mirzapur in Northern
India and from Natal, and of antelope horn from an unrecorded locality
in India. In cases of scorpion sting the Dommara rubbed up patent
boluses with human milk or milk of the milk-hedge plant (<i>Euphorbia
Tirucalli</i>), and applied them to the part. For chest pains he
prescribed red ochre, and for infantile diseases myrabolam
(<i>Terminalia</i>) fruits mixed with water. In cases of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>snake-bite, a black stone, said to be made of
various drugs mixed together, and burnt, is placed over the seat of the
bite, and will, it was stated, drop off of its own accord as soon as it
has absorbed all the poison. It is then put into milk or water to
extract the poison, and the fluid is thrown away as being dangerous to
life if swallowed. As a remedy for the bite of a mad dog, a plant,
which is kept a secret, is mixed with the milk of a white goat, pepper,
garlic, and other ingredients, and administered internally. A single
dose is said to effect a cure.</p>
<p>At Tarik&#275;ri in Mysore, a wandering troupe of &#256;r&#275;
(Mar&#257;tha) Dommaras performed before me. The women were decorated
with jewels and flowers, and carried bells on their ankles. The men had
a row of bells attached all round the lower edge of their short
drawers. Before the performance commenced, a Pillayar (Gan&#275;sa) was
made with cowdung, and saluted. The entertainment took place in the
open air amid the beating of drums, whistling, singing, and dialogue.
The jests and antics of the equivalent of the circus clown were a
source of much joy to the throng of villagers who collected to witness
the tam&#257;sha (spectacle). One of the principal performers, in the
waits between his turns, played the drum, or took a suck at a hooka
(tobacco pipe) which was passed round among the members of the troupe.
The entertainment, in which both men and women took part, consisted of
various acrobatic feats, turning summersaults and catherine wheels,
stilt-walking, and clever feats on the tight rope. Finally a man,
climbing up a lofty bamboo pole, spun himself rapidly round and round
on the top of it by means of a socket in an iron plate tied to his loin
cloth, into which a spike in the pole fitted. <span class=

<p><b>Donga D&#257;sari.</b>&mdash;D&#257;sari (servant of the god),
Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3671src" href=
"#xd21e3671" name="xd21e3671src">61</a> &ldquo;in the strict sense of
the word, is a religious mendicant of the Vaishnavite sect, who has
formally devoted himself to an existence as such, and been formally
included in the mendicant brotherhood by being branded on the shoulders

D&#257;saris, who receive their name from the fact that &ldquo;the men
and women disguise themselves as D&#257;saris, with perpendicular
Vaishnava marks on their foreheads, and, carrying a lamp (Garuda
kambum), a gong of bell-metal, a small drum called jagata, and a tuft
of peacock feathers, go begging in the villages, and are at times
treated with the sumptuous meals, including cakes offered to them as

<p>In an interesting article on the Donga D&#257;saris, Mr. S. M.
Natesa Sastri writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3679src"
href="#xd21e3679" name="xd21e3679src">63</a> &ldquo;Quite opposed to
the gudi (temple) D&#257;saris are Donga D&#257;saris. They are the
most dreaded of the criminal classes in the Bellary district. In the
early years of their settlement in Bellary, these Donga D&#257;saris
were said to have practiced kidnapping boys and girls of other castes
to strengthen their number, and even now, as the practice stands, any
person can become a Donga D&#257;sari though very few would like to
become one. But, for all that, the chief castes who furnished members
to this brotherhood of robbery were the scum of the Lingayats and the
Kabb&#275;ras. Of course, none of the respectable members of these
castes would join them, and only those who were excommunicated found a
ready home among these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>Donga D&#257;saris. Sometimes
Muhammadan budm&#257;shes (bad-m&#257;sh, evil means of livelihood) and
the worst characters from other castes, also become Donga D&#257;saris.
The way an alien is made a Donga D&#257;sari is as follows. The regular
Donga D&#257;saris take the party who wants to enter their brotherhood
to the side of a river, make him bathe in oil, give him a new cloth,
hold a council, and give a feast. They burn a twig of the sami
(<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>) or margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) tree,
and slightly burn the tongue of the party who has joined them. This is
the way of purification and acceptance of every new member, who, soon
after the tongue-burning ceremony, is given a seat in the general
company, and made to partake of the common feast. The Donga
D&#257;saris talk both Telugu and Kanarese. They have only two bedagas
or family names, called Sunna Akki (thin rice) and Ghantelav&#257;ru
(men of the bell). As the latter is a family name of the Kabb&#275;ras,
it is an evidence that members of the latter community have joined the
Donga D&#257;saris. Even now Donga D&#257;saris intermarry with
Kabb&#275;ras, <i>i.e.</i>, they accept any girl from a Kabb&#275;ra
family in marriage to one of their sons, but do not give one of their
daughters in marriage to a Kabb&#275;ra boy. Hanum&#257;n is their
chief god. Venkat&#275;sa, an incarnation of Vishnu, is also worshipped
by many. But, in every one of their villages, they have a temple
dedicated to their village goddess Huligavva or Ellamma, and it is only
before these goddesses that they sacrifice sheep or fowls. Vows are
undertaken for these village goddesses when children fall ill. In
addition to this, these Donga D&#257;saris are notorious for taking
vows before starting on a thieving expedition, and the way these
ceremonies are gone through is as follows. The gang, before starting on
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>thieving expedition, proceed to a jungle near
their village in the early part of the night, worship their favourite
goddesses Huligavva or Ellamma, and sacrifice a sheep or fowl before
her. They place one of their turbans on the head of the sheep or fowl
that was sacrificed, as soon as the head falls on the ground. If the
turban turns to the right, it is considered a good sign, the goddess
having permitted them to proceed on the expedition; if to the left,
they return home that night. Hanum&#257;n is also consulted in such
expeditions, and the way in which it is done is as follows. They go to
a Hanum&#257;n temple which is near their village, and, after
worshipping him, garland him with a wreath of flowers. The garland
hangs on both sides of the neck. If any flowers on the right side drop
down first, it is considered as a permission granted by the god to
start on plundering expeditions, and, conversely, these expeditions are
never undertaken if any flowers happen to drop from the left side
first. The Donga D&#257;saris start on their thieving raids with their
whole family, wife and children following. They are the great experts
in house-breaking and theft, and children are taught thieving by their
mothers when they are five or six years old. The mother takes her boy
or girl to the nearest market, and shows the child some cloth or
vessel, and asks it to bring it away. When it fails, it is thrashed,
and, when stroke upon stroke falls upon its back, the only reply it is
taught to give is that it knows nothing. This is considered to be the
reply which the child, when it grows up to be a man or woman, has to
give to the police authorities when it is caught in some crime and
thrashed by them to confess. Whenever the Donga D&#257;saris are caught
by the police, they give false names and false castes. They have a
cipher language among themselves. The Donga <span class=

astray with a Br&#257;hman, Lingayat, Kabb&#275;ra, Kuruba, Upparava,
or R&#257;jput, her tongue is burnt, and she is taken back into the
community. Widow remarriage freely prevails. They avoid eating beef and
pork, but have no objection to other kinds of flesh.&rdquo;</p>

described by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3749src" href=
"#xd21e3749" name="xd21e3749src">65</a> as &ldquo;Muhammadans who have
taken to the trade of cotton-cleaning (d&#363;de, cotton; ekula, to
clean). By the Tamils they are called Panj&#257;ri or Panjukotti, which
have the same significance. Though Muhammadans, they have adopted or
retained many of the customs of the Hindus around them, tying a
t&#257;li to the bride at marriage, being very ignorant of the
Muhammadan religion, and even joining in Hindu worship as far as
allowable. Circumcision is, however, invariable, and they are much
given to the worship of Muhammadan saints. In dress they resemble the
Hindus, and often shave off the beard, but do not leave a single lock
of hair upon the head, as most Hindus do. Over three hundred Hindus
have returned their caste as either D&#363;d&#275;kula or Panj&#257;ri,
but these are probably members of other castes, who call themselves
D&#363;d&#275;kula as they are engaged in cotton-cleaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&#363;d&#275;kulas are described by Mr. W. Francis<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3754src" href="#xd21e3754" name=
"xd21e3754src">66</a> as &ldquo;a Muhammadan caste of cotton-cleaners,
and rope and tape-makers. They are either converts to Isl&#257;m, or
the progeny of unions between Musalmans and the women of the country.
Consequently they generally speak the Dravidian languages&mdash;either
Canarese or Telugu&mdash;but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>some of them speak Hindust&#257;ni
also. Their customs are a mixture of those of the Musalmans and the
Hindus. Inheritance is apparently according to Muhammadan law. They
pray in mosques, and circumcise their boys, and yet some of them
observe the Hindu festivals. They worship their tools at Bakrid and not
at the Dasara; they raise the az&#257;n or Muhammadan call to prayers
at sunset, and they pray at the tombs of Musalman saints.&rdquo; In the
Vizagapatam district, the D&#363;d&#275;kulas are described as beating
cotton, and blowing horns.</p>
<p>For the following note on the D&#363;d&#275;kulas of the Ceded
Districts, I am indebted to Mr. Haji Khaja Hussain. They claim Bava
Faqrud-d&#299;n P&#299;r of Penukonda in the Anantapur district as
their patron saint. Large numbers of Muhammadans, including
D&#363;d&#275;kulas, collect at the annual festival (m&#275;la) at his
shrine, and offer their homage in the shape of a fatiha. This, meaning
opener, is the name of the first chapter of the Kor&#257;n, which is
repeated when prayers are offered for the souls of the departed. For
this ceremony a pilau, made of flesh, rice and gh&#299; (clarified
butter) is prepared, and the Kh&#257;zi repeats the chapter, and offers
the food to the soul of the deceased saint or relation.</p>
<p>The story of Faqrud-d&#299;n P&#299;r is as follows. He was born in
A.H. 564 (about A.D. 1122), and was King of Seistan in Persia. One day,
while he was administering justice, a merchant brought some horses
before him for sale. His attention was diverted, and he became for a
time absorbed in contemplation of the beauty of one of the horses.
Awakening from his reverie, he blamed himself for allowing his thoughts
to wander when he was engaged in the most sacred of his duties as a
king. He summoned a meeting of all the learned moulvis in his kingdom,
and enquired of them what was the penalty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>for his conduct. They
unanimously decreed that he should abdicate. Accordingly he placed his
brother on the throne, and, becoming a dervish, came to India, and
wandered about in the jungles. Eventually he arrived at Trichinopoly,
and there met the celebrated saint Tabri-&#256;lam, whose disciple he
became. After his admission into holy orders, he was told to travel
about, and plant his misw&#257;k wherever he halted, and regard the
place where it sprouted as his permanent residence. The misw&#257;k, or
tooth-brush, is a piece of the root of the p&#299;l&#363; tree
(<i>Salvadora persica</i>), which is used by Muhammadans, and
especially Fakirs, for cleaning the teeth. When Bava Faqrud-d&#299;n
arrived at Penukonda hill, he, as usual, planted the misw&#257;k, which
sprouted. He accordingly decided to make this spot his permanent abode.
But there was close by an important Hindu temple, and the idea of a
Muhammadan settling close to it enraged the Hindus, who asked him to
leave. He not only refused to do so, but allowed his disciples, of whom
a number had collected, to slaughter a sacred bull belonging to the
temple. The Hindus accordingly decided to kill Faqrud-d&#299;n and his
disciples. The R&#257;ja collected an armed force, and demanded the
restoration of the bull. Faqrud-d&#299;n ordered one of his disciples
to bring before him the skin, head, feet and tail of the animal, which
had been preserved. Striking the skin with his staff, he exclaimed
&ldquo;Rise, Oh! bull, at the command of God.&rdquo; The animal
immediately rose in a complete state of restoration, and would not
leave the presence of his preserver. Alarmed at this miracle, the
Hindus brandished their swords and spears, and were about to fall on
the Muhammadans, when a dust-storm arose and blinded them. In their
confusion, they began to slay each other, and left the spot in dismay.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>R&#257;ja then resolved to kill the Muhammadans
by poisoning them. He prepared some cakes mixed with poison, and sent
them to Faqrud-d&#299;n for distribution among his disciples. The
saint, though he knew that the cakes were poisoned, partook thereof of
himself, as also did his disciples, without any evil effect. A few days
afterwards, the R&#257;ja was attacked with colic, and his case was
given up by the court physicians as hopeless. As a last resort, he was
taken before Faqrud-d&#299;n, who offered him one of the poisoned
cakes, which cured him. Falling at his feet, the R&#257;ja begged for
pardon, and offered the village of Penukonda to Faqrud-d&#299;n as a
jagh&#299;r (annuity). This offer was declined, and the saint asked
that the temple should be converted into a mosque. The R&#257;ja
granted this request, and it is said that large numbers of Hindus
embraced the Muhammadan religion, and were the ancestors of the
D&#363;d&#275;kulas.</p>
<p>The D&#363;d&#275;kulas, like the Hindus, like to possess some
visible symbol for worship, and they enrol great personages who have
died among the number of those at whose graves they worship. So
essential is this grave worship that, if a place is without one, a
grave is erected in the name of some saint. Such a thing has happened
in recent times in Banganapalle. A Fakir, named All&#257; Bakhsh, died
at Kurnool. A D&#363;d&#275;kula of the Banganapalle State visited his
grave, took away a lump of earth from the ground near it, and buried it
in a village ten miles from Banganapalle. A shrine was erected over it
in the name of the saint, and has become very famous for the miracles
which are performed at it. An annual festival is held, which is
attended by large numbers of Muhammadans and D&#363;d&#275;kulas.</p>
<p>Some D&#363;d&#275;kulas have names which, though at first sight
they seem to be Hindu, are really Muhammadan. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>For
example, Kambannah is a corruption of Kamal Sahib, and Sakali, which in
Telugu means a washerman, seems to be an altered form of Sheik
&#256;li. Though D&#363;d&#275;kulas say that they are Muhammadans of
the Sheik sect, the name Sheik is only occasionally used as a prefix,
<i>e.g.</i>, Sheik Hussain or Sheik &#256;li. Names of males are
Hussain Sa, Fakir Sa, and Kh&#257;sim Sa. Sa is an abbreviated form of
Sahib. One old D&#363;d&#275;kula stated that the title Sahib was
intended for pucka (genuine) Muhammadans, and that the
D&#363;d&#275;kulas could not lay claim to the title in its entirety.
Instead of Sa, Bhai, meaning brother, is sometimes used as a suffix to
the name, <i>e.g.</i>, Ghudu Bhai. Ghudu, meaning ash-heap, is an
opprobrious name given to children of those whose offspring have died
young, in the hope of securing long life to them. The child is taken,
immediately after birth, to an ash-heap, where some of the ashes are
sprinkled over it. Some D&#363;d&#275;kulas adopt the Hindu termination
appa (father), anna (brother), or gadu, <i>e.g.</i>, Pullanna,
N&#257;ganna, Yerkalappa, Hussaingadu, Hussainappa. Typical names of
females are Roshamm&#257;, Jamalamm&#257;, and Madaramm&#257;. They
have dropped the title Bibi or Bi, and adopted the Hindu title
amm&#257; (mother).</p>
<p>The ceremony of naming a child is generally performed on the sixth
day after its birth. The choice of a name is entrusted to an elderly
female member of the family. In some cases, the name of a deceased
ancestor who lived to an advanced age is taken. If a child dies
prematurely, there is a superstitious prejudice against its name, which
is avoided by the family. Very frequently a father and son, and
sometimes two or three brothers, have the same name. In such a case
prefixes are added to their names as a means of distinguishing them,
<i>e.g.</i>, Pedda (big), Nadpi (middle), Chinna (little). Sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>two names are assumed by an individual, one a
Hindu name for every day use, the other Muhammadan for ceremonial
occasions.</p>
<p>The D&#363;d&#275;kulas depend for the performance of their
ceremonies largely on the Kh&#257;zi, by whom even the killing of a
fowl for domestic purposes has to be carried out. The
D&#363;d&#275;kula, like other Muhammadans, is averse to taking animal
life without due religious rites, and the zabh, or killing of an animal
for food, is an important matter. One who is about to do so should
first make vazu (ablution), by cleaning his teeth and washing his
mouth, hands, face, forearms, head and feet. He should then face the
west, and an assistant holds the animal to be slaughtered upside down,
and facing west. Water is poured into its mouth, and the words
Bismill&#257; hi All&#257; hu Akbar uttered. The operator then cuts the
throat, taking care that the jugular veins are divided. In remote
villages, where a Kh&#257;zi is not available, the D&#363;d&#275;kulas
keep a sacrificial knife, which has been sanctified by the Kh&#257;zi
repeating over it the same words from the Kor&#257;n as are used when
an animal is slaughtered.</p>
<p>The first words which a Muhammadan child should hear are those of
the az&#257;n, or call to prayer, which are uttered in its ear
immediately after birth. This ceremony is observed by those
D&#363;d&#275;kulas who live in towns or big villages, or can afford
the services of a Kh&#257;zi. It is noted by Mr. Francis that the
D&#363;d&#275;kulas raise the az&#257;n at sunset. A few, who have been
through a course of religious instruction at a Madrasa (school), may be
able to do this. A Muhammadan is supposed to raise the az&#257;n five
times daily, viz., before sunrise, between noon and 3 <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>, between 4 and 6 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, at
sunset, and between 8 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> and midnight.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the naming of an infant on the sixth day, the D&#363;d&#275;kulas
do not, like other Muhammadans, perform the aguig&#257; ceremony, which
consists of shaving the child&rsquo;s head, and sacrificing a he-goat.
Children are circumcised before the tenth year. On such occasions the
Muhammadans generally invite their friends, and distribute sweets and
p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel leaf and areca nuts). The
D&#363;d&#275;kulas simply send for a barber, Hindu or Muhammadan, who
performs the operation in the presence of a Kh&#257;zi, if one happens
to be available. When a girl reaches puberty, the D&#363;d&#275;kulas
invite their friends to a feast. Other Muhammadans, on the contrary,
keep the fact a secret.</p>
<p>At the betrothal ceremony, when sweets and p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri are
taken by the future bridegroom and his party to the house of the girl
whom he seeks in marriage, the female members of both families, and the
girl herself, are present. This fact shows the absence of the
Muhammadan g&#333;sha system among D&#363;d&#275;kulas. A Muhammadan
wedding lasts over five or six days, whereas the ceremonies are, among
the D&#363;d&#275;kulas, completed within twenty-four hours. On the
night preceding the nikka day, a pilau is prepared, and a feast is held
at the bridegroom&rsquo;s house. On the following morning, when it is
still dark, the bridegroom, accompanied by his relations, starts on
horseback in procession, with beating of drums and letting off of
fireworks. The procession arrives at the bride&rsquo;s house before
sunrise. The Kh&#257;zi is sent for, and the mahr is settled. This is a
nominal gift settled on the wife before marriage by the bridegroom. On
the death of a husband, a widow has priority of claim on his property
to the promised amount of the mahr. Two male witnesses are sent to the
bride, to obtain her assent to the union, and to the amount of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>the mahr. The Kh&#257;zi, being an orthodox
Muhammadan, treats the D&#363;d&#275;kula bride as strictly g&#333;sha
for the time being, and, therefore, selects two of her near relatives
as witnesses. The lutcha (marriage badge), consisting of a single or
double string of beads, is brought in a cup filled with sandal
paste.</p>
<p>The Kh&#257;zi chants the marriage service, and sends the lutcha in
to the bride with his blessing. It is tied round her neck by the female
relations of the bridegroom, and the marriage rites are over.</p>
<p>The usual Muhammadan form of greeting among Muhammadans is the
familiar &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And with you be
peace.&rdquo; When a D&#363;d&#275;kula greets a Muhammadan, he simply
bows, and, with members of his own community, uses a Telugu form of
salutation, <i>e.g.</i>, n&#299;ku mokkut&#257;mu.</p>
<p>The D&#363;d&#275;kulas, male and female, dress exactly like Hindus,
but, as a rule, the men do not shave their beard.</p>
<p>Disputes, and social questions affecting the community, are settled
by a Kh&#257;zi.</p>
<p>With the increase in cotton mills, and the decline of the indigenous
hand-weaving industry, the demand for cotton-cleaning labour has
diminished, and some D&#363;d&#275;kulas have, of necessity, taken to
agriculture. Land-owners are very scarce among them, but some are
abk&#257;ri (liquor) contractors, village schoolmasters, and quack
doctors. In the Ceded Districts, the cotton-cleaning industry is solely
confined to the D&#363;d&#275;kulas.</p>
<p>The synonyms of D&#363;d&#275;kula, Ladaf and N&#363;rb&#257;sh,
recorded at times of census, are corruptions of Nad-d&#257;f (a cotton
dresser) and N&#363;rb&#257;f (weaving).</p>

<p><b>Ediann&#257;ya</b> (hornet&rsquo;s nest).&mdash;An exogamous sept
of Bant.</p>
<p><b>Egad&#257;van.</b>&mdash;Recorded, at times of census, as an
exogamous sept of Anappans, who are Canarese cattle-grazers settled in
the Tamil country. Possibly it is a corruption of Heggade, a title
among Kurubas.</p>
<p><b>Ek&#257;kshara.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of S&#257;t&#257;ni. The
name is derived from Ek&#257;kshara, meaning one syllable, i.e., the
mystic syllable &#332;m.</p>
<p><b>&#274;k&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;This caste is summed up in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, under the names &#274;k&#257;ri, &#274;kali,
Y&#257;kari, and Y&#257;karlu, as a sub-caste of Mutr&#257;cha. Mr. H.
A. Stuart writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3879src" href="#xd21e3879"
name="xd21e3879src">1</a> that &ldquo;Ekaris or Y&#257;karlu are a
class of cultivators and village watchmen, found chiefly in the
northern taluks of North Arcot, and in the adjoining district of
Cuddapah. It is very doubtful whether the Ekaris and Mutr&#257;chas are
identical castes. The census statistics are, I think, sufficient to
throw grave doubt on this view. Neither name, for instance, appears as
a sub-division of the other, although this would certainly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>be
the case if they were synonymous. Nor is there any similarity in the
sub-divisions that are given. They are said, in the Nellore Manual, to
be hunters and mercenaries, and in Cuddapah, where they are known to
some as B&#333;yas and Kir&#257;tas, they are classed as a forest
tribe. It is clear, however, that they enjoyed some authority, for
several rose to be poligars. Thus the poligars of Kall&#363;r, Tumba,
Pulicherla, Bang&#257;ri and Gudip&#257;ti are of this caste, and many
of its members are village policemen. They do not wear the sacred
thread, but employ Br&#257;hmans as their priests. Their ceremonies
differ very little from those of the K&#257;pus. They are flesh-eaters,
and their titles are Naidu and Dora. The caste possesses some interest
as being that which had, in 1891, the highest proportion of widowed
among females between the ages of 15 and 39. Little is known of the
caste history. Some assert that they were formerly Hindu cotton
cleaners, and that their name is derived from the verb yekuta, to clean
cotton. They returned 74 sub-divisions, of which the most important
seem to be Dodda (big) and Pala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is neither intermarriage, nor free interdining between
&#274;k&#257;ris and Mutr&#257;chas. By some, Kampin, and Nagiripilla
k&#257;yalu, and by others Kammi and Yerrai were given as
sub-divisions.</p>
<p>One of the recognised names of washermen in Tamil is Eg&#257;li or
Ek&#257;li.</p>
<p><b>Elakayan.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of N&#257;yar. It is recorded,
in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;its hereditary
occupation is to get plantain leaves for the use of the Cherukunnu
temple, where travellers are fed daily by the Chirakkal
R&#257;ja.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Elayad.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the Elayads or
Ilayatus I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>Ilayatu literally means younger, and the name is
employed to denote a caste, which is supposed to be the last among the
numerous sub-divisions of Malabar Br&#257;hmans. The caste-men make use
of two titles, Ilayatu and Nambiyatiri, the latter of which has the
same origin as Namb&#363;tiri, meaning a person worthy of worship.
Women are generally known as Ilayammas, and, in some parts of North
Travancore, also Kunjammas. By the caste-men themselves the women are
called Akattulavar, or those inside, in the same way as Namb&#363;tiri
women. Children are called Kunjunnis. The Ilayatus exact from the
N&#257;yars the name of Ilayachchan, or little father.</p>
<p>According to the Jatinirnaya, a work ascribed to Parasur&#257;ma,
the Ilayatus were once Br&#257;hmans of undiminished purity, but became
degraded owing to the priestly service which was performed for a
N&#257;yar servant attached to one of their households. Two members of
the house of Azhv&#257;ncheri Tampr&#257;kkal were brothers. The
younger resolved to go to a foreign country, and could get no other
N&#257;yar servant than one who was obliged to perform his
mother&rsquo;s anniversary ceremony on the way. He promised to act as
the priest on this occasion, and is even believed to have eaten the
food prepared by the N&#257;yar. When the matter became known to his
elder brother, he assembled all the Vaidik Br&#257;hmans, and the
younger brother was excommunicated. This tradition, like the majority
of Malabar traditions, has to be accepted with reserve. The Ilayatus
assert that, until interdicted by R&#257;ma Iyen Dalawa in revenge for
a supposed dishonour to him, they had the privilege of commensality
with Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans; but R&#257;ma Iyen&rsquo;s
authority, large as it was, did not extend to Cochin and British
Malabar, where too the Ilayatus appear to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>labour under the same
difficulty. Those who encouraged the higher classes of N&#257;yars with
ritualistic functions became Onnam Parisha or the first party of
Ilayatus, the remainder being grouped in another class known as
Rand&#257;m or second party. The latter are lower in the social scale
than the former. The two sections do not intermarry, and interdining is
restricted to the male sex.</p>
<p>The Ilayatus generally have a dejected appearance, and their poverty
is proverbial. Most of them earn only a scanty living by their
traditional occupation, and yet it is notorious that other walks of
life have absolutely no attraction for them. Not only is English
education not welcomed, but even the study of Sanskrit finds only a few
steadfast votaries. The Ilayatus are, however, a naturally clever, and
intelligent community, and, under favourable conditions, are found to
take a more prominent place in society.</p>
<p>The house of an Ilayatu is, like that of a Namb&#363;tiri, called
illam. It is generally large, being the gift of some pious N&#257;yar.
Every Ilayatu house possesses a serpent grove, where periodical
offerings are made. The dress and ornaments of the Ilayatus are exactly
like those of the Namb&#363;tiris. The wedding ornament is called
kettu-t&#257;li. Children wear a ring tied to a thread round the neck
from the moment of the first feeding ceremony. The Ilayatus are strict
vegetarians, and, though in some of their temples they have to make
offerings of liquor to the deity, they are strictly forbidden by caste
rules from partaking thereof.</p>
<p>The chief occupation of the Ilayatus is the priesthood of the
N&#257;yars. The first division perform this service only for the
Ilakkar or highest class of N&#257;yars, while the second division do
not decline to be the priests of any section of that community. In
performing such services, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>the Ilayatus recite various
liturgic texts, but hardly any V&#275;dic hymns. The Ilayatus have also
been the recognised priests in several North Travancore temples, the
chief of which are the Kainikkara Bhagavata shrine, the Payappara
S&#257;sta shrine, and the Par&#275;kk&#257;vu Siva temple at
K&#363;tt&#257;ttukulam. Ilayatus are the priests in most of the snake
groves of Malabar, that at Mann&#257;rsalay commanding the greatest
popularity and respect.</p>
<p>Ilayatus are, in all matters of caste such as Smarta-vicharam, or
enquiry into charges of adultery, etc., governed by the
Namb&#363;tiris, who are assisted by Vaidiks belonging to the caste
itself. It is the latter who are the regular priests of the Ilayatus,
and, though ignorant of the V&#275;das, they seem to possess
considerable knowledge of the priestly functions as carried out in
Malabar. Namb&#363;tiris are sometimes invited to perform
Isvaras&#275;va, Sarpabali, and other religious rites. Purification
rites are performed by the caste priests only, and no Namb&#363;tiri is
called on to assist. Br&#257;hmans do not cook food in the houses of
Ilayatus.</p>
<p>The Ilayatus are divided mostly into two septs or g&#333;tras,
called Visv&#257;mitra and Bh&#257;radv&#257;ja. The marriage of girls
is performed before or after puberty, between the twelfth and
eighteenth years. No bride-price is paid, but a sum of not less than
Rs. 140 has to be paid to the bridegroom. This is owing to the fact
that, in an <span class="corr" id="xd21e3915" title=
"Source: Ilayutu">Ilayatu</span> family, as among the Namb&#363;tiris,
only the eldest son can lead a married life. All male members of a
family, except the eldest, take to themselves some N&#257;yar or
Ambalav&#257;si woman. Widows do not remove their tuft of hair on the
death of their husband, but throw their marriage ornament on to the
funeral pyre, probably as a symbol of the performance of sati. The
Ilayatus resemble the Namb&#363;tiris in all questions of inheritance.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Ilayatus do not omit any of the sixteen religious ceremonies of
the Br&#257;hmans. The rules of name given are that the eldest son
should be named after the paternal grandfather, the second after the
maternal grandfather, and the third after the father. A parallel rule
obtains in giving names to daughters.</p>
<p>The Ilayatus belong in the main to the white and black branches of
the Yajurv&#275;da, and observe the s&#363;tras of Bodhayana and
Asvalayana. They recite only twenty-four Gayatri hymns, thrice a day.
Women are believed to be polluted for ninety days after childbirth.</p>
<p>It is noted in the Cochin Census Report, 1901, that the Elayads are
&ldquo;their own priests, and for this reason, and from the fact that
N&#257;yars perform sr&#257;dhas (memorial service) in the houses of
Elayads, the Namb&#363;dris do not cook or take meals in their houses,
nor do they, Kshatriyas or Nampidis, take water from Elayads. In former
times, the Elayads used to take their meals in N&#257;yar houses during
the performance of the sr&#257;dha ceremony of the N&#257;yars, as
Br&#257;hmans generally do on such ceremonial occasions amongst
themselves, but they now decline to do it, except in a few wealthy and
influential families. M&#363;thads and Elayads wear the sacred thread.
Though in many respects the Elayads are more Br&#257;hmanical than the
M&#363;thads, the majority of the Ambalav&#257;si castes do not take
the food cooked or touched by the Elayads. There are some temples, in
which they officiate as chief priests. The M&#363;thad and Elayad
females are g&#333;sha. They both practice polygamy, and perform
Sarvaswad&#257;nam marriages like the Namb&#363;dris.&rdquo;</p>

as meaning &ldquo;a cow-herd. A sub-division of the N&#257;yar caste,
which formerly ruled in what is now the Ern&#257;d t&#257;luk&rdquo; of
Malabar. In the Malabar Manual, Ern&#257;d is said to be derived from
Er&#257;du, the bullock country. Er&#257;di denotes, according to the
Census Report, 1891, &ldquo;a settlement in Ern&#257;d. The caste of
S&#257;mantas, to which the Zamorin of Calicut belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Eravallar.</b>&mdash;The Eravallars are a small forest tribe
inhabiting the Coimbatore district and Malabar. For the following note
on the Eravallars of Cochin, I am indebted to Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna
Iyer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4014src" href="#xd21e4014" name=
"xd21e4014src">6</a></p>
<p>Eravallars are a wild tribe of inoffensive hill-men found in the
forests of the Cochin State, especially in the Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk.
They are also called Villu V&#275;dans (hunters using bows). Their
language is Tamil, though some speak Malay&#257;lam. In addressing the
elderly members of the caste, they use the titles Muthan (elder) and
Pattan (grandfather). Names in use for males are Kannan (Krishna),
Otukan, Kothandan, Kecharan, and Attukaran, while females are called
Kanni, Keyi, Kaikayi, Otuka, and R&#257;mayi. These Hindu divine names
are recent innovations after the names of members of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>the
higher castes, with whom they frequently come in contact.</p>
<p>The Eravallars have no knowledge of the origin of their caste. They
appear to be a rude and primitive people, like the other jungle tribes
of the State, but are somewhat improving their status under their
masters. Their habits are less migratory than those of the Malayars and
K&#257;dars. They live in villages called pathis, situated in the
forests. Their huts are similar to those of the Malayars and
K&#257;dars. They propitiate their sylvan deities before the
construction of their huts, and also before their occupation. Some days
are believed to be lucky, as Mondays for sowing and weddings,
Wednesdays for building, and Fridays for reaping.</p>
<p>Eravallars do not live as small independent communities, but are
mostly attached to farmers, under whom they work for a daily wage of
two edangazhis and a half of paddy (unhusked rice). The women also work
for the same wage, but never agree to serve in a state of bondage.
During the festival kathira in the village temple of their landlords,
when sheaves of corn are brought, every male member gets from his
landlord two veshtis (a cloth with a coloured border 3 yards in
length), and every woman a potava (coloured cloth 8 yards in length).
During the &#332;nam and Vishu festivals, one para of paddy, two
cocoanuts, a small quantity of gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) and cocoanut
oil are also given. The landlords partly defray their marriage and
funeral expenses by a grant of a few paras of paddy, some salt and
chillies. Sometimes they agree to work for twenty valloms (a large corn
measure) a year. To improve their condition, they borrow money from
their landlords, and purchase a bullock or buffalo or two, to cultivate
a plot of land, after clearing a portion of the forest belonging
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>to their master. They raise some crops, and make
some saving to pay off the debt. Should they be so unfortunate as to
fail in the undertaking, they willingly mortgage themselves to their
master, or to some other, for the wages above mentioned, and wait for
some favourable opportunity to pay off the debt. Women never surrender
themselves to work in a state of bondage, but are independent
day-labourers. The Eravallars are, as certified by their masters,
always truthful, honest, faithful and god-fearing, and never, like the
Pulayas of the northern parts of the State, ungratefully run away from
their masters.</p>
<p>A girl, when she comes of age, is lodged in a separate hut
(muttuch&#257;la) erected at a distance of a furlong from the main hut.
Only a few girl friends are allowed to be in company with her during
the period of her seclusion, which is generally seven days, during
which food is served to her at a distance, when she comes to take it.
No grown-up member approaches her, for fear of pollution. She bathes on
the morning of the seventh day, and is then allowed to enter the hut.
The day is one of festivity to her friends and relations. If a girl is
married before she attains puberty, her husband contributes something
for the expenses of the ceremony. Should a woman cohabit with a man
before marriage and become pregnant, she used, in former times, to be
put to death, but is now turned out of caste. Instances of the kind
are, they say, extremely rare.</p>
<p>An Eravallan who wishes to see his son married visits the parents of
a girl with his brother-in-law and a few relatives, who make the
proposal. If the parents agree, the wedding day is fixed, and all the
preliminary arrangements are made at the hut of the bride, where the
relatives assembled are treated to a dinner. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>bride&rsquo;s price is only a rupee. The parents
of the bride and bridegroom visit their respective landlords with a few
packets of betel leaves, areca nuts, and tobacco, and inform them of
the marriage proposal. The landlords give a few paras of paddy to
defray a portion of the wedding expenses. They celebrate their weddings
on Mondays. On a Monday previous to the wedding ceremony, the sister of
the bridegroom, with a few of her relations and friends, goes to the
bride&rsquo;s hut, and presents her parents with the bride&rsquo;s
money, and a brass ring for the bride. On the Monday chosen for the
wedding, the same company, and a few more, go there, and dress the girl
in the new garment brought by them. They are treated to a dinner as on
the previous occasion. They then return with the bride to the hut of
the bridegroom, where also the parties assembled are entertained. On
the Monday after this, the bridegroom and bride are taken to the
bride&rsquo;s hut, where they stay for a week, and then return to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s hut. Marriage is now formally over. The t&#257;li
(marriage badge) tying is dispensed with. This custom of marriage
prevails among the Izhuvas of the Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk. The
bridegroom gets nothing as a present during the wedding, but this is
reserved for the Karkadaka Sankranthi, when he is invited by his
father-in-law, and given two veshtis and a turban, after sumptuously
feeding him. A widow can only marry a widower. It is called
Mundakettuka (marrying a widow). When they both have children, the
widower must make a solemn promise to his castemen that he will treat
and support the children by both marriages impartially. The present of
a brass ring and cloth is essential. A man can divorce his wife, if he
is not satisfied with her. The divorced wife can mate only with a
widower. Such cases, they say, are very rare among them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>No ceremony is performed for a pregnant woman during the fifth or
seventh month. If she dreams of dogs, cats, or wild animals coming to
threaten her, it is believed that she is possessed of demons. Then a
devil-driver from this or some other caste is called in. He draws a
hideous figure (k&#333;lam) on the floor with powdered rice, turmeric,
and charcoal, and the woman is seated in front of it. He sings and
beats his small drum, or mutters his mantram (consecrated formula). A
lamp is lighted, and frankincense is burned. A kaibali is waved round
the woman&rsquo;s face. She is worked up to a hysterical state, and
makes frantic movements. Boiled rice, flattened rice, plantains,
cocoanuts, and fowl are offered to the demon. Quite satisfied, the
demon leaves her, or offers to leave her on certain conditions. If the
woman remains silent and unmoved all the time, it is supposed that no
demon resides in her body. Very often a yantram (charm) is made on a
piece of cadjan (palm) leaf, and rolled. It is attached to a thread,
and worn round the neck.</p>
<p>A woman in childbirth is located in a separate small hut
(muttuch&#257;la) erected at a distance from the main hut. Nobody
attends upon her, except her mother or some old woman to nurse her. As
soon as delivery takes place, the mother and child are bathed. Her
pollution is for seven days, during which she stays in the hut. She
then bathes, and is removed to another hut close to the main hut, and
is again under pollution for five months. Her diet during this period
is simple, and she is strictly forbidden to take meat. The only
medicine administered to her during the period is a mixture of pepper,
dried ginger, and palm sugar mixed with toddy. She comes back to the
main hut after purifying herself by a bath at the end of the five
months. The day is one of festivity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Eravallers bury their dead, and observe death pollution for five
days. On the morning of the sixth day, the chief mourner, who may be
the son or younger brother, gets shaved, bathes, and offers to the
spirit of the departed boiled rice, parched rice, plantains, and fowl.
A feast is given to the castemen once a year, when they have some
savings. They think of their ancestors, who are propitiated with
offerings.</p>
<p>They are pure animists, and believe that the forests and hills are
full of demons disposed to do them harm. Many of them are supposed to
live in trees, and to rule wild beasts. They also believe that there
are certain local demons, which are supposed to reside in rocks, trees,
or peaks, having influence over particular families or villages, and
that services rendered to them are intended to mitigate their hunger
rather than to seek benefits. Their gods are K&#257;li, Muni, Kannimar,
and Karappu R&#257;yan. K&#257;li is adored to obtain her protection
for themselves and their families while living in the forest. Muni is
worshipped for the protection of their cattle, and to secure good
harvest. Kannimar (the seven virgins) and Karappu R&#257;yan are their
family deities, who watch over their welfare. Offerings of boiled rice,
plantains, cocoanuts, and flattened rice are given to propitiate them.
K&#257;li and Muni are worshipped in the forest, and the others in
their huts.</p>
<p>The main occupation of the Eravallers is ploughing dry lands for the
cultivation of chama (<i>Panicum miliaceum</i>), cholam (<i>Sorghum
vulgare</i>), dholl (<i>Cajanus indicus</i>) and gingelly (<i>Sesamum
indicum</i>) seeds, and sowing the seeds, which begin in the middle of
May, and harvesting in November. During these months, they are wholly
occupied with agriculture. During the other months of the year,
gardening, fencing, and thatching are their chief <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>occupations. Offerings are made to K&#257;li and
Muni, when they plough, sow, and reap. They are so propitiated, as they
are supposed to protect their corn from destruction by wild beasts. The
Eravallers are skilful hunters. Owing to their familiarity and
acquaintance with the forests, they can point out places frequented by
wild beasts, which they can recognise by smell, either to warn
travellers against danger, or to guide sportsmen to the game. Ten or
fifteen of them form a party, and are armed with knives, bows and
arrows. Some of them act as beaters, and the animal is driven to a
particular spot, where it is caught in a large net already spread,
shot, or beaten to death. Animals hunted are hares, porcupines, and
wild pigs. The game is always equally divided. Being good marksmen,
they take skilful aim at birds, and kill them when flying.</p>
<p>The ordinary dietary is kanji (gruel) of chama or cholam, mixed with
tamarind, salt and chillies, prepared overnight, and taken in the
morning. The same is prepared for the midday meal, with a vegetable
curry consisting of dholl, horse gram (<i>Dolichos biflorus</i>), and
other grains grown in the garden of their masters, which they have to
watch. They eat the flesh of sheep, fowls, pigs, hares, quails, and
doves. They take food at the hands of Br&#257;hmans, N&#257;yars,
Kamm&#257;lars, and Izhuvas. They refuse to take anything cooked by
Mannans, P&#257;nans, Parayans, and Cherumans. They bathe when touched
by a Chakkiliyan, Parayan, or Cheruman. They stand a long way off from
Br&#257;hmans and N&#257;yars.</p>
<p>Both men and women are decently clad. Males wear veshtis, one end of
which hangs loose, and the other is tucked in between the legs. They
have a shoulder cloth, either hanging loosely over their shoulders, or
sometimes tied to the turban. They allow their hair to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>grow
long, but do not, for want of means, anoint it with oil. They grow
moustaches. They wear round the neck a necklace of small white beads to
distinguish them from Malayars, who are always afraid of them. Some
wear brass finger rings. Women wear a potava (coloured cloth), half of
which is worn round the loins, while the other half serves to cover the
body. The hair is not smoothed with oil. It is twisted into a knot on
the back. It is said that they take an oil bath once a week. Their ear
ornament is made of a long palmyra leaf rolled into a disc, and the ear
lobes are sufficiently dilated to contain them.</p>
<p><b>Erkollar.</b>&mdash;A Tamil form of the Telugu Yerragolla, which
is sub-division of Tottiyan.</p>
<p><b>Ern&#257;dan.</b>&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the
Aran&#257;dans are described as a hill tribe in Malabar, who kill
pythons, and extract an oil from them, which they sell to people on the
plains as a remedy for leprosy. These are, I have no doubt, the
Ern&#257;dans, concerning whom Mr. G. Hadfield writes to me as follows.
They are a small jungle tribe, found exclusively in Malabar, and are
considered to be the lowest of the jungle tribes by the inhabitants of
Malabar, who consider themselves polluted if an Ern&#257;dan approaches
within a hundred yards. Even Paniyans and Pariahs give them a wide
berth, and they are prohibited from coming within four hundred yards of
a village. One of their customs is very singular, viz., the father of a
family takes (or used to take) his eldest daughter as his second wife.
The Ern&#257;dans use bows and arrows, principally for shooting
monkeys, to the flesh of which they are very partial. They are not
particular as to what they eat, and are, in fact, on a par with jackals
in this respect, devouring snakes and the putrid flesh of various
animals. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>are fond of collecting the fat of snakes, and
selling it. Muhammadans employ them in felling timber, and cultivating
fields. Their clothing is exceedingly scanty, and, when hard up, they
use wild plantain leaves for this purpose.</p>
<p>Through Mr. Hadfield&rsquo;s influence with the tribe, Mr. F.
Fawcett was able to examine a few members thereof, who appeared before
him accompanied by their M&#257;ppilla master, at a signal from whom
they ran off like hares, to attend to their work in the fields. Their
most important measurements were as follows:&mdash;</p>

definition in &lsquo;Hobson-Jobson,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4166src" href="#xd21e4166" name="xd21e4166src">7</a> be summed up
as a modern name for persons of mixed European and Indian blood,
devised as being more euphemistic than half-caste, and more precise
than East-Indian. When the European and Anglo-Indian Defence
Association was established <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>17 years ago, the term
Anglo-Indian, after much consideration, was adopted as best designating
the community. According to Stocqueler,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4171src" href="#xd21e4171" name="xd21e4171src">8</a> the name
Eurasian was invented by the Marquis of Hastings. East Indian is
defined by Balfour<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4174src" href=
"#xd21e4174" name="xd21e4174src">9</a> as &ldquo;a term which has been
adopted by all classes of India to distinguish the descendants of
Europeans and Native mothers. Other names, such as half-caste,
chatikar, and chi-chi, are derogatory designations. Chattikar is from
chitta (trousers) and kar (a person who uses them). The Muhammadans
equally wear trousers, but concealed by their outer long gowns. The
East Indians are also known as Farangi (Frank), a person of Europe. The
humbler East Indians, if asked their race, reply that they are
Wallandez or Oollanday, which is a modification of Hollandais, the name
having been brought down through the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries from the Dutch. East Indians have, in India, all the rights
and privileges of Europeans. Races with a mixture of European with
Asiatic blood possess a proud and susceptible tone of mind.&rdquo; For
the purposes of the Lawrence Asylum, Ootacamund, the word East Indian
is restricted to the children of European fathers by East Indian or
Native mothers, or of East Indian fathers and mothers, both of whom are
the children of European fathers.</p>
<p>By a ruling of the Government of India a few years ago, it was
decided that Eurasians appointed in England to official posts in India
are, if they are not statutory Natives, to be treated as Europeans as
regards the receipt of exchange compensation allowance.</p>
<p>Some Eurasians have, it may be noted, had decorations or knighthood
conferred on them, and risen to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>highest position in,
and gained the blue ribbon of, Government service. Others have held, or
still hold, positions of distinction in the various learned
professions, legal, medical, educational, and ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>The influence of the various European nations&mdash;Portuguese,
Dutch, British, Danish, and French&mdash;which have at different times
acquired territory in peninsular India, is clearly visible in the
polyglot medley of Eurasian surnames, <i>e.g.</i>, Gomes, Da Souza,
Gonsalvez, Rozario, Cabral, Da Cruz, Da Costa, Da Silva, Da Souza,
Fernandez, Fonseca, Lazaro, Henriquez, Xavier, Mendonza, Rodriguez,
Saldana, Almeyda, Heldt, Van Spall, Jansen, Augustine, Brisson,
Corneille, La Grange, Lavocat, Pascal, DeVine, Aubert, Ryan, McKertish,
Macpherson, Harris, Johnson, Smith, etc. Little did the early
adventurers, in the dawn of the seventeenth century, think that, as the
result of their alliances with the native women, within three centuries
banns of marriage would be declared weekly in Madras churches between,
for example, Ben Jonson and Alice Almeyda, Emmanuel Henricus and Mary
Smith, Augustus Rozario and Minnie Fonseca, John Harris and Clara
Corneille. Yet this has come to pass, and the Eurasian holds a
recognised place among the half-breed races of the world.</p>
<p>The pedigree of the early Eurasian community is veiled in obscurity.
But the various modes of creation of a half-breed, which were adopted
in those early days, when the sturdy European pioneers first came in
contact with the native females, were probably as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the early days of the British occupation of Madras, the traders
and soldiers, arriving with an inadequate equipment of females,
contracted alliances, regular or irregular, with the women of the
country. And in these early days, when our territorial possessions were
keenly contested with both European and Native enemies, an attempt was
made, under authority from high places, to obtain, through the medium
of the British soldier, and in accordance with the creed that crossing
is an essential means of improving a race, and rendering it vigorous by
the infusion of fresh blood from a separate stock, a good cross, which
should be available for military purposes. Later on, as the number of
the British settlers increased, connexions, either with the Native
women, or with the females of the recently established Eurasian type,
were kept up owing to the difficulty of communication with the
mother-country, and consequent difficulty in securing English brides.
Of these barbaric days the detached or semi-detached bungalows in the
spacious grounds of the old private houses in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>Madras remain as a memorial. At the present day
the conditions of life in India are, as the result of steamer traffic,
very different, and far more wholesome. The Eurasian man seeks a wife
as a rule among his own community; and, in this manner, the race is
mainly maintained.</p>
<p>The number of Eurasians within the limits of the Madras Presidency
was returned, at the census, 1891, as 26,643. But on this point I must
call Mr. H. A. Stuart, the Census Commissioner, into the witness box.
&ldquo;The number of Eurasians,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is 26,643,
which is 20.76 per cent. more than the number returned in 1881.&rdquo;
The figures for the last three enumerations are given in the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be seen that, between 1871 and 1881, there was a
great decrease, and that the numbers in 1891 are slightly higher than
they were twenty years ago. The figures, however, are most
untrustworthy. The cause is not far to seek; many persons, who are
really Natives, claim to be Eurasians, and some who are Eurasians
return themselves as Europeans. It might be thought that the errors due
to these circumstances would be fairly constant, but the district
figures show that this cannot be the case. Take Malabar, for example,
which has the largest number of Eurasians after Madras, and where the
division between Native Christians with European names and people of
real mixed race is very shadowy. In 1871 there were in this district
5,413 Eurasians; in 1881 the number had apparently fallen to 1,676;
while in 1891 it had again risen to 4,193, or, if we include South-east
Wynaad, as we should do, to 4,439. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>It is to be regretted that
trustworthy statistics cannot be obtained, for the question whether the
true Eurasian community is increasing or decreasing is of considerable
scientific and administrative importance. The Eurasians form but a very
small proportion of the community, for there is only one Eurasian in
every 1,337 of the population of the Madras Presidency, and it is more
than probable that a considerable proportion of those returned as
Eurasians are in reality pure Natives who have embraced the Christian
religion, taken an English or Portuguese name, and adopted the European
dress and mode of living. In the matter of education, or at least
elementary education, they are more advanced than any other class of
the community, and compare favourably with the population of any
country in the world. They live for the most part in towns, nearly
one-half of their number being found in the city of Madras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the fact that, at times of census, Native
Christians and Pariahs, who masquerade in European clothes, return
themselves as Eurasians, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, it may be
accepted that some benefit must be derived by the individual in return
for the masking of his or her nationality. And it has been pointed out
to me that (as newspaper advertisements testify) many ladies will
employ a Native ayah rather than a Eurasian nurse, and that some
employers will take Eurasian clerks into their service, but not Native
Christians. It occasionally happens that pure-bred Natives, with
European name and costume, successfully pass themselves off as
Eurasians, and are placed on a footing of equality with Eurasians in
the matter of diet, being allowed the luxury of bread and butter,
coffee, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart had at his command no special statistics of the
occupations resorted to by Eurasians, but states that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>the
majority of them are clerks, while very few obtain their livelihood by
agriculture. In the course of my investigations in the city of Madras,
the following occupations were recorded:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the analysis of a hundred male cases in Madras, in which
enquiries were made with reference to the married state, in individuals
ranging in age from 21 to 50, with an average age of 33, I learn that
74 were married; that 141 male and 130 female children had been born to
them; and that 26, whose average age was 25, were unmarried. The limits
of age of the men at the time of marriage were 32 and 16; of their
wives 25 and 13. The greatest number of children born to a single
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>pair was 10. In only three cases, out of the
seventy-four, was there no issue. In fifty cases, which were examined,
of married men, with an average age of 34, 207 children had been born,
of whom 91 had died, for the most part in early life, from
&lsquo;fever&rsquo; and other causes.</p>
<p>The racial position of Eurasians, and the proportion of black blood

quadroon, octoroon, sambo (or zambo), etc., but in fractions of a
rupee. The European pure breed being represented by Rs.
0&ndash;0&ndash;0, and the Native pure breed by 16 annas (= 1 rupee),
the resultant cross is, by reference to colour and other tests, gauged
as being half an anna in the rupee (faint admixture of black blood),
approaching European types; eight annas (half and half); fifteen annas
(predominant admixture of black blood), approaching Native types,
etc.</p>
<p>The Eurasian body being enveloped in clothes, it was not till they
stripped before me, for the purpose of anthropometry, that I became
aware how prevalent is the practice of tattooing among the male members
of the community. Nearly all the hundred and thirty men (of the lower
classes) whom I examined were, in fact, tattooed to a greater or less
extent on the breasts, upper arms, forearms, wrists, back of the hands,
or shoulders. The following varied selection of devices in blue, with
occasional red, is recorded in my case-book:&mdash;</p>

<p>The most elaborate patterns were executed by Burmese tattooers. The
initials of the individual&rsquo;s Christian and surnames, which
preponderated over other devices, were, as a rule, in Roman, but
occasionally in Tamil characters.</p>
<p>In colour the Eurasians afford examples of the entire colour scale,
through sundry shades of brown and yellow, to pale white, and even
florid or rosy. The pilous or hairy system was, in the cases recorded
by me, uniformly black. The colour of the iris, like that of the skin,
is liable to great variation, from lustrous black to light, with a
predominance of dark tints. Blue was observed only in a solitary
instance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=

<p>The Eurasian resists exposure to the sun better than the European,
and, while many wear solah topis (pith sun-hats), it is by no means
uncommon to see a Eurasian walking about in the middle of a hot day
with his head protected only by a straw hat or cap.</p>
<p>The average height of the Eurasians examined by me in Madras,
according to my measurements of 130 subjects, is 166.6 cm. (5 feet
5&frac12; inches), and compares as follows with that of the English and
various Native classes inhabiting the city of Madras:&mdash;</p>

<p>The character of the nose is, as those who have studied ethnology in

<p>I pass on to the Eurasians of the west coast. My visit to Calicut,
the capital of the Malabar district, was by chance coincident with the
commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the arrival of Vasco
da Gama at Calicut after his discovery of the sea-route from Europe to
India. Concerning the origin of the Indo-Portuguese half-breed, I
learn<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5856src" href="#xd21e5856" name=
"xd21e5856src">11</a> that, on his return from the recapture of Goa,
Albuquerque brought with him the women he had carried away when the
Portuguese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>were driven out of the place. As soon as affairs
became tolerably settled again at that port, he had them converted to
Christianity, and married them to Portuguese men. No less than 450 of
his men were thus married in Goa, and others who desired to follow
their example were so numerous that Albuquerque had great difficulty in
granting their requests. The marriage of Portuguese men to native women
had already been sanctioned by Dom Manuel, but this privilege was only
to be conceded to men of proved character, and who had rendered good
service. Albuquerque, however, extended the permission to many far
beyond what he was authorised to do, and he took care that the women so
married were the daughters of the principal men of the land. This he
did in the hope of inducing them to become Christians. To those who
were married Albuquerque allotted lands, houses and cattle, so as to
give them a start in life, and all the landed property which had been
in possession of the Moorish mosques and Hindu pagodas he gave to the
principal churches of the city, which he dedicated to Santa
Catherina.</p>
<p>The names of some members of the community at Calicut recalled to
mind Pedro Alvares Cabral, who anchored before Calicut in 1500, and
established a factory at Cochin; the first Portuguese Governor, Dom
Franciso de Almeida; Andr&eacute; Furtado de Mendonca, who concluded a
treaty with the king of Calicut; and many others, whose exploits are
handed down to posterity in the Indo-Portuguese archives. Though
Portuguese names persist at the present day, it does not follow of
necessity that their owners have any Portuguese blood in their veins,
for some are merely descendants of Native converts to Christianity, or
of household slaves of Portuguese officers. &ldquo;In Malabar,&rdquo;
writes the Census <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235"
name="pb235">235</a>]</span>Commissioner, 1881, &ldquo;there is a
section of Europeanized Native Christians&mdash;Goa Roman
Catholics&mdash;some of whom have adopted European dress and customs;
and in all districts the popular interpretation of the word Eurasian is
very liberal. There are many Pariahs and Native Christians, who have
adopted a travesty of European clothes, and who would return themselves
as Eurasians, if allowed to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A social distinction is made at Calicut between Eurasians and East
Indians. With a view at clearing up the grounds on which this
distinction is based, my interpreter was called on to submit a note on
the subject, which arrived couched in language worthy of Mark Twain. I,
therefore, reproduce it in the original Indo-Anglian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eurasians are classified to those who stand second in the
list of Europeans and those born in any part of India, and who are the
Pedigree of European descendants, being born of father European and
mother East Indian, and notwithstanding those who can prove themselves
as really good Indian descendants, such as mother and father of the
same sex, therefore these are called Eurasians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;East Indians are those offsprings of Christians of the East,
and they atimes gather the offsprings of Eurasians to the entering
their marriage to the East Indian females in the East Indian community,
thereby they are called East Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Native Christians are those of Hindu nations converted into
Christians by their embracing the poles of Christianity. All Hindus
thereby converted are made Christians by a second Baptism are called
Native Christians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coaster. They are alluded to those who belong to the Coast,
and who come from a country that has a Sea <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>Coast into that country that has not got a Sea
Coast is therefore called a Coaster. A very rude word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking in general terms, it may be said that Eurasians are of
greater stature, and possess skins of lighter hue than the East
Indians, who, as the result of intermarriage with Native Christian
women, have reverted in the direction of the Native type.</p>
<p>The Eurasians examined by me at Calicut, nearly all of whom were
Roman Catholics, were earning a livelihood in the following
capacities:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are, in North Malabar, many individuals, whose fathers were
European. Writing, in 1887, concerning the Tiyan community, Mr. Logan
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5975src" href="#xd21e5975" name=
"xd21e5975src">12</a> that &ldquo;the women are not as a rule
excommunicated if they live with Europeans, and the consequence is that
there has been among them a large admixture of European blood, and the
caste itself has been materially raised in the social scale. In
appearance some of the women are almost as fair as Europeans.&rdquo; On
this point, the Report of the Malabar Marriage Commission, 1894, states
that &ldquo;in the early days of British rule, the Tiyan women incurred
no social disgrace by consorting with Europeans, and, up to the last
generation, if the Sudra girl could boast of her Brahmin lover, the
Tiyan girl could show more substantial benefits from her alliance with
a white man of the ruling race. Happily the progress of education, and
the growth of a wholesome public opinion, have made shameful the
position of a European&rsquo;s concubine; and both races have thus been
saved from a mode of life equally demoralizing to each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a visit to Ootacamund on the N&#299;lgiri hills, I was
enabled to examine the physique of the elder boys at the Lawrence
Asylum, the object of which is &ldquo;to provide for children of
European and East Indian officers and soldiers of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Army (British and Native), and of Europeans and East Indians in the
Medical Service, military and civil, who are serving, or have served
within the limits of the Presidency of Madras, a refuge from the
debilitating effects of a tropical climate, and from the serious
drawbacks to the well-being of children incidental to a barrack life;
to afford for them a plain, practical, and religious education; and to
train <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>them for employment in different trades,
pursuits, and industries.&rdquo; As the result of examination of
thirty-three Eurasian boys, I was able to testify to the excellence of
their physical condition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5983src" href=
"#xd21e5983" name="xd21e5983src">13</a> A good climate, with a mean
annual temperature of 58&deg;, good food, and physical training, have
produced a set of boys well-nourished and muscular, with good chests,
shoulders, and body weight.</p>
<p>Some final words are necessary on liability to certain diseases, as
a differentiating character between Eurasians and Europeans. The Census
Commissioner, 1891, states that Eurasians seem to be peculiarly liable
to insanity and leprosy. To these should be added elephantiasis
(filarial disease), concerning which Surgeon-Major J. Maitland writes
as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5990src" href="#xd21e5990" name=
"xd21e5990src">14</a> &ldquo;Almost all the old writers on
elephantiasis believed that the dark races were more susceptible to the
disease than white people; but it is extremely doubtful if this is the
case. It is true that, in those countries where the disease is endemic,
the proportion of persons affected is much greater among the blacks
than among the whites; but it has to be borne in mind that the habits
of the former render them much more liable to the disease than the
latter. The majority of the white people, being more civilised, are
more careful regarding the purity of their drinking water than the
Natives, who are proverbially careless in this respect. In India,
although it is comparatively rare to meet with Europeans affected with
the disease, yet such cases are from time to time recorded. Eurasians
are proportionately more liable to the disease than pure Europeans, but
not so much so as Natives. Doctors Patterson and Hall of Bahia<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5993src" href="#xd21e5993" name=
"xd21e5993src">15</a> examined the blood of 309 persons in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>that
place, and found the following proportions affected with filaria; of
whites, 1 in 26; of blacks, 1 in 10&frac14;; of the mixed race, 1 in 9.
Doctor Laville<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5998src" href="#xd21e5998"
name="xd21e5998src">16</a> states that, in the Society Islands, out of
a total of 13 European and American residents, 11 were affected with
elephantiasis. Taking all these facts into consideration, together with
our knowledge of the pathology of the disease, I do not think we are
justified in saying that the black races are more susceptible to the
disease than white people. On the other hand, owing to the nature of
their habits, they are much more liable to the diseases than are the
white races.&rdquo; During the five years 1893&ndash;97, ninety-eight
Eurasians suffering from filarial diseases were admitted into the
General Hospital, Madras.</p>
<p>To Colonel W. A. Lee, I.M.S., Superintendent of the Government Leper
Asylum, Madras, I am indebted for the following note on leprosy in its
relation to the Eurasian and European communities. &ldquo;Europeans are
by no means immune to the disease, which, in the majority of instances,
is contracted by them through coitus with leprous individuals. Leprosy
is one of the endemic diseases of tropical and sub-tropical countries,
to the risk of contracting which Europeans who settle on the plains of
India, and their offspring from unions with the inhabitants of the
land, as well as the descendants of the latter, become exposed, since,
by the force of circumstances, they are thrown into intimate contact
with the Native population. The Eurasian community furnishes a
considerable number of lepers, and the disease, once introduced into a
family, has a tendency to attack several of its members, and to
reappear in successive generations, occasionally skipping one&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>feature akin to the biological phenomenon known
as atavism, but of perhaps doubtful analogy, for the possibility of a
fresh infection or inoculation has always to be borne in mind. There
are numerous instances of such hereditary transmission among the
patients, both Native and Eurasian, in the Leper Hospital. The spread
of the disease by contagion is slow, the most intimate contact even,
such as that between parent and child, often failing to effect
inoculation. Still there is much evidence in support of its being
inoculable by cohabitation, prolonged contact, wearing the same
clothing, sharing the dwelling, using the same cooking and eating
utensils, and even by arm-to-arm vaccination. Influenced by a belief in
the last mentioned cause, vaccination was formerly regarded with much
suspicion and dislike by Eurasians in Madras. But their apprehensions
on this score have abated since animal vaccine was substituted for the
humanised material. It has also for long been a popular belief among
the same class that the suckling of their infants by infected Native
wet-nurses is a common source of the disease. Attempts to reproduce
leprosy from supposed pure cultures of the leprosy bacillus have
invariably failed, and this strengthens the belief that the disease
would die out if sufferers from the tubercular or mixed forms were
segregated, and intermarriage with members of known leprous families
interdicted. Experience shows that, where such marriages are freely
entered into, a notable prevalence of the disease results, as at
Pondicherry for example, where the so-called creole population is said
to contain a large proportion of lepers from this cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing concerning the prevalence of insanity in different classes,
the Census Commissioner, 1891, states <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>that &ldquo;it
appears from the statistics that insanity is far more prevalent among
the Eurasians than among any other class. The proportion is 1 insane
person in every 410. For England and Wales the proportion is 1 in every
307, and it is significant that the section of the population of
Madras, which shows the greatest liability to insanity, is that which
has an admixture of European blood. I have no information regarding the
prevalence of insanity among Eurasians for any other province or State
in India except Mysore, and there the proportion is 1 in
306.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving out of question the Europeans, in whom, owing to the
preponderance of the male sex in Madras, a greater number of male than
female lunatics is to be expected, and considering only Eurasians and
Natives, the far higher proportion of female as compared with male
lunatics in the Eurasian than in the Native community, is very
conspicuous. Taking, for example, the numbers remaining in the Asylum
in 1894. Whereas the proportion of Eurasian males to females was 33:31,
that of Natives was 30.6:6.8; and the high proportion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>of
female Eurasian inmates was visible in other years. The subject seems
to be one worthy of further study by those competent to deal with
it.</p>

<p class="first"><b>G&#257;bit.</b>&mdash;A Bombay fishing caste
returned at the census, 1901. To Malpe in the South Canara district,
during the fishing season, come fishermen with a flotilla of keeled and
outrigged sailing boats from Ratnagiri in the Bombay Presidency. Hither
also come fishermen from Goa. The reasons given by the Ratnagiri
fishermen for coming southward are that fish are not so abundant off
their own coast, competition is keener, and salt more expensive.
Moreover, the crystals of Bombay salt are too large for successful
curing, and &ldquo;do not agree with the fish, of which the flesh is
turned black.&rdquo; If, they said contemptuously, they were to sun-dry
fish by the local method, their people would laugh at them for bringing
back, not fish, but dried cow-dung for fuel. The Ratnagiri boats go
well out of sight of land to the fishing ground, where they catch seir,
pomfret, cat-fish (<i>Arius</i>), and other big fish near the surface,
and sharks in deeper water. If the fishing is not good near Malpe, they
may go south as far as Mangalore. To the Ratnagiri fishermen the seir
(<i>Cybium</i>) is the most valuable and lucrative fish. Under existing
arrangements, by which clashing of interests is avoided, the fishery at
Malpe is divided into two zones, viz., the deep sea fished by the large
Ratnagiri boats, and the shallow littoral water by the smaller local
and Goa boats.</p>
<p><b>Gadaba.</b>&mdash;The Gadabas are a tribe of agriculturists,
coolies, and hunters in the Vizagapatam district. Hunting is said to be
gradually decreasing, as many of the forests are now preserved, and
shooting without a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243"
name="pb243">243</a>]</span>license is forbidden. Men sometimes occupy
themselves in felling trees, catching birds and hares, and tracking and
beating game for sportsmen. The Gadabas are also employed as bearers in
the hills, and carry palanquins. There is a settlement of them on the
main road between Sembliguda and Koraput, in a village where they are
said to have been settled by a former R&#257;ja expressly for such
service. It is said that the Gadabas will not touch a horse, possibly
because they are palanquin-bearers, and have the same objection to the
rival animal that a cabman has for a motor-car.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that the tribe owes its name to the fact that
its ancestors emigrated from the banks of the God&#257;bari
(God&#257;vari) river, and settled at Nandapur, the former capital of
the R&#257;jas of Jeypore. The Gadabas have a language of their own, of
which a vocabulary is given in the Vizagapatam Manual. This language is
included by Mr. G. A. Grierson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6135src"
href="#xd21e6135" name="xd21e6135src">1</a> in the Mund&#257;
linguistic family.</p>
<p>The tribe is apparently divided into five sections, called Bodo
(big) or Gut&#333;b, P&#257;renga, Ol&#257;ro, Kaththiri or Kaththara,
and K&#257;pu. Of these, the last two are settled in the plains, and
say that they are Bodo and Ol&#257;ro Gadabas who migrated thither from
the hills. As among the Gadabas, so among the Savaras, there is a
section which has settled on the plains, and adopted K&#257;pu as its
name. In the Madras Census Report, 1891, nearly a thousand Gadabas are
returned as belonging to the Chenchu sub-division. Chenchu is the name
of a separate jungle tribe in the Telugu country, and I have been
unable to confirm the existence of a Chenchu sub-division among the
Gadabas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1871, Mr. H. G. Turner states that
&ldquo;very much akin to the Gadabas are a class called Kerang
K&#257;pus. They will not admit any connexion with them; but, as their
language is almost identical, such gainsaying cannot be permitted them.
They are called Kerang K&#257;pu from the circumstance of their women
weaving cloths, which they weave from the fibre of a jungle shrub
called Kerang (<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>).&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
remarks<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6146src" href="#xd21e6146" name=
"xd21e6146src">2</a> that &ldquo;the K&#257;pu Gadabas are possibly the
Kerang K&#257;pus mentioned by Mr. Turner as akin to the Gadabas, for I
find no mention of the caste under the full name of Kerang K&#257;pu,
nor is Kerang found as a sub-division of either K&#257;pu or
Gadaba.&rdquo; Writing concerning the numeral system of the Kerang
K&#257;pus, Mr. Turner observes that it runs thus: Moi, Umbar, Jugi, O,
Malloi, Turu, G&#363;, Tammar, Santing, Goa, and for eleven (1 and
following numbers), they prefix the word Go, <i>e.g.</i>, Gommoi,
Gomb&#257;ro, etc. The Kerang K&#257;pus can count up to nineteen, but
have no conception of twenty. According to Mr. W. Francis, the only
tribe on the hills which has this system of notation is the Bonda
Poraja. The Gadabas have very similar names for the first five
numerals; but, after that, lapse into Oriya, <i>e.g.</i>, s&#257;t,
&#257;t, n&#333;, das, etc. The Bonda Poraja numerals recorded by Mr.
Francis are m&#363;yi, baar, gii, oo, moloi, thiri, goo, tham&#257;m,
and so on up to nineteen, after which they cannot count. This system,
as he points out, agrees with the one described by Mr. Turner as
belonging to the Kerang K&#257;pus. The Gut&#333;b Gadaba numerals
recorded by Mr. C. A. Henderson include muititti (1 + a hand), and
martitti (2 + a hand). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href=
"#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some Gadaba women wear a bustle or dress improver, called irr&#275;
or kitt&#275;. This article of attire is accounted for by the following
tradition. &ldquo;A goddess visited a Gadaba village <i>incognito</i>,
and asked leave of one of the women to rest on a cot. She was brusquely
told that the proper seat for beggars was the floor, and she
consequently decreed that thenceforth all Gadaba women should wear a
bustle to remind them to avoid churlishness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6161src" href="#xd21e6161" name="xd21e6161src">3</a> The
Gadaba female cloths are manufactured by themselves from cotton thread
and the fibre of silloluv&#257;da or ankudi chettu (<i>Holarrhena
antidysenterica</i>) and b&#333;da luv&#257;da or bodda chettu
(<i>Ficus glomerata</i>). The fibre is carefully dried, and dyed blue
or reddish-brown. The edges of the cloth are white, a blue strip comes
next, while the middle portion is reddish-brown with narrow stripes of
white or blue at regular intervals. The Gadabas account for the dress
of their women by the following legend. When R&#257;ma, during his
banishment, was wandering in the forests of Dandaka, his wife S&#299;ta
accompanied him in spite of his entreaties to the contrary. It was one
of the cruel terms of his stepmother Kaika that R&#257;ma should wear
only clothing made from jungle fibre, before leaving the capital.
According to the Hindu religion, a virtuous wife must share both the
sorrows and joys of her lord. Consequently S&#299;ta followed the
example of R&#257;ma, and wore the same kind of clothing. They then
left the capital amidst the loud lamentation of the citizens. During
their wanderings, they met some Gadaba women, who mocked and laughed at
S&#299;ta. Whereupon she cursed them, and condemned them to wear no
other dress but the cloth made of fibre. In a note on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>Gadabas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6173src"
href="#xd21e6173" name="xd21e6173src">4</a> Mr. L. Lakshminarayan
writes that &ldquo;although mill-prepared cloths are fast replacing
house-spun cloths in all communities, yet, in the case of the Gadabas,
there is a strong superstition which prevents the use of cloths
prepared outside, particularly in regard to the cloths worn by their
women. The legend (about S&#299;ta) is fully believed by the Gadabas,
and hence their religious adherence to their particular cloth. At the
time of marriage, it is absolute that the Gadaba maiden should wear
this fibre-made cloth, else misfortune will ruin the family. A bundle
of twigs is brought, and the stems freed of leaves are bruised and
twisted to loosen the bark, and are then dried for two or three days,
after which the bark is ripped out and beaten down smooth with heavy
sticks, to separate the bark from the fibre. The fibre is then
collected, and combed down smooth, and spun into a tolerably fine
twist. It is this twist that the Gadaba maiden weaves in her crude
loom, and prepares from it her marriage s&#257;ri. According to a good
custom among these people, a Gadaba maiden must learn to weave her
cloths before she becomes eligible for marriage. And no Gadaba ever
thinks of marrying a wife who cannot prepare her own cloths. Men can
use cotton and other cloths, whereas women cannot do so, for they are
under the curse of S&#299;ta. But the passion for fineries in woman is
naturally so strong that the modern Gadaba woman is now taking the
liberty of putting cotton thread for the woof and ankudu fibre for the
warp, and thus is able to turn out a more comfortable and finer cloth.
But some old crones informed me that this mixed cloth is not so
auspicious as that prepared wholly from the fibre.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some Gadaba women wear immense earrings made of long pieces of brass
wire wound into a circle, which hang down from a hole in the ear, and
sometimes reach to the shoulders. The wire is sold in the shandy
(market) at so much a cubit. The head-dress of some of the women
consists of a chaplet of <i>Oliva</i> shells, and strings of beads of
various sizes and colours, or the red and black berries of <i>Abrus
precatorius</i>, with pendants which hang over the forehead. The women
also wear bead necklaces, to which a coin may sometimes be seen
attached as a pendant. Bracelets and rings are as a rule made of brass
or copper, but sometimes silver rings are worn. Toe-rings and brass or
silver anklets are considered fashionable ornaments. Among the
Ol&#257;ro Gadabas, the wearing of brass anklets by a woman indicates
that she is married. For teaching backward children to walk, the
Gadabas employ a bamboo stick split so as to make a fork, the prongs of
which are connected by a cross-bar. The apparatus is held by the
mother, and the child, clutching the cross-bar, toddles along.</p>
<p>Among the Bodo and Ol&#257;ro sections, the following septs
occur:&mdash;K&#333;ra (sun), N&#257;g (cobra), Bh&#257;g (tiger),
K&#299;ra (parrot), and Goll&#257;ri (monkey). The Gadabas who have
settled in the plains seem to have forgotten the sept names, but will
not injure or kill certain animals, <i>e.g.</i>, the cobra.</p>
<p>Girls are as a rule married after puberty. When a young man&rsquo;s
parents think it time for him to get married, they repair to the home
of an eligible girl with rice and liquor, and say that they have come
to ask a boon, but do not mention what it is. They are treated to a
meal, and return home. Some time afterwards, on a day fixed by the
Dis&#257;ri, three or four aged relatives of the young <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>man
go to the girl&rsquo;s house, and the match is fixed up. After a meal,
they return to their homes. On the day appointed for the wedding
ceremonies, the bridegroom&rsquo;s relations go to the home of the
bride, taking with them a rupee towards the marriage expenses, a new
cloth for the girl&rsquo;s mother, and half a rupee for the females of
the bride&rsquo;s village, which is regarded as compensation for the
loss of the girl. To the bride are given a glass bead necklace, and
brass bangles to be worn on the right wrist. A feast follows. On the
following day, the bride is conducted to the village of the bridegroom,
in front of whose home a pandal (booth), made of four bamboo poles,
covered with green leaves, has been erected. Within the pandal, stems
of the s&#257;l (<i>Shorea robusta</i>), addagirli, and bamboo joined
together, are set up as the auspicious post. Beside this a grindstone
is placed, on which the bride sits, with the bridegroom seated on her
thighs. The females present throw turmeric powder over them, and they
are bathed with turmeric-water kept ready in a new pot. They are then
presented with new cloths, and their hands are joined together by the
officiating Dis&#257;ri. A feast, with much drinking, follows, and the
day&rsquo;s proceedings conclude with a dance. On the following day,
mud is heaped up near the pandal, into which the Dis&#257;ri throws a
handful of it. The remainder of the mud is carried into the pandal by
the contracting couple, who pour water over it, and throw it over those
who are assembled. All then proceed to a stream, and bathe. A further
feast and dance follows, of which the newly married couple are
spectators, without taking part in it.</p>
<p>In a note on marriage among the P&#257;renga Gadabas, Mr. G. F.
Paddison writes that they have two forms of marriage rite, one of which
(bib&#257;) is accompanied by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249"
href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>much feasting, gifts of
bullocks, toddy, rice, etc. The most interesting feature is the fight
for the bride with fists. All the men on each side fight, and the
bridegroom has to carry off the bride by force. Then they all sit down,
and feast together. In the other form (lethulia), the couple go off
together to the jungle, and, when they return, pay twenty rupees, or
whatever they can afford, to the girl&rsquo;s father as a fine. A
dinner and regular marriage follow elopement and payment of the
fine.</p>
<p>The ghorojavai system, according to which a man works for a stated
period for his future father-in-law, is practiced by the Gadabas. But a
cash payment is said to be now substituted for service. The remarriage
of widows is permitted, and a younger brother may marry the widow of
his elder brother. If she does not marry him, the second husband has to
pay a sum of money, called in Oriya the r&#257;nd tonka, to him. When a
man divorces his wife, her relations are summoned, and he pays her two
rupees before sending her away. Of this sum, one rupee is paid as
buchni for suspicion regarding her chastity, and the other as chatni
for driving her away. A divorced woman may remarry.</p>
<p>In the hills, the village headman is called Janni or N&#257;yako,
and in the plains Naid&#257;do. He is assisted by a K&#299;ras&#257;ni,
who is also the caste priest.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the Gadabas, Mr. H. D. Taylor
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6208src" href="#xd21e6208" name=
"xd21e6208src">5</a> that it is &ldquo;simple, and consists of feasts
at stated intervals. The chief festival is Ittakaparva, or hunting
feast, in March and April. On this occasion, the whole male population
turns out to hunt, and, if they return unsuccessful, the women pelt
them with cow-dung on their return to the village; if, however,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>successful, they have their revenge upon the
women in another way. The chief deities (though spoken of generally
under the term D&#275;vata or Mah&#257;prabhu) are Ganga D&#275;vi or
T&#257;kur&#257;ni, Iswara or Mouli, Bhairava, and Jhankara. It is
Iswara or Mouli who is worshipped at Chaitra. Jhankara is the god of
land, rainfall and crops, and a cow is sacrificed to him. There are
not, as a rule, temples, but the p&#363;ja (worship) place consists of
a sacred grove surrounded with a circle of stones, which takes the name
of Jhankara from the god to whom p&#363;ja is performed. Ganga
D&#275;vi, Iswara and Mouli have temples at certain places, but as a
rule there is no building, and the site of p&#363;ja is marked by trees
and stones. To Iswara a she-buffalo is sacrificed at Chaitra. To the
other D&#275;vatas cocks and goats are sacrificed. Ganga D&#275;vi or
T&#257;kur&#257;ni is the goddess of life and health, both of men and
cattle; to her pigs, goats, and pigeons are sacrificed. There are one
or two curious superstitions. If a member of the caste is supposed to
be possessed of a devil, he or she is abused and beaten by other
members of the caste until the devil is cast out. In some parts the
superstition is that a piece of wild buffalo horn buried in the ground
of the village will avert or cure cattle disease.&rdquo; Sometimes a
s&#257;l or k&#333;sangi tree is planted, and surrounded by a bamboo
hedge. It is worshipped with animal sacrifices at harvest time, and the
K&#299;ras&#257;ni acts as priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Mr. G. F. Paddison writes, &ldquo;rather a
curious custom in connection with a village goddess. Close to her
shrine a swing is kept. On this swing, once a year at the great village
festival, thorns are placed, and the village priest or priestess sits
on them without harm. If the p&#363;j&#257;ri is a male, he has been
made neuter. But, if the village is not fortunate enough <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>to
possess a eunuch, a woman performs the ceremony. [At the fire-walking
ceremony at Nuvag&#333;de in Ganjam, the priest sits on a thorny swing,
and is endowed with prophetic powers.] When there is small-pox or other
epidemic disease in a village, a little go-cart is built, composed of a
box on legs fixed to a small board on wheels. In this box is placed a
little clay image, or anything else holy, and carried away to a distant
place, and left there. A white flag is hoisted, which looks like
quarantine, but is really intended, I think, to draw the goddess back
to her shrine. Vaccination is regarded as a religious ceremony, and the
Gadabas, I believe, invariably present the vaccinator as the
officiating priest with rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gadabas, like other hill tribes, name their children after the
day of the week on which they are born. On the plains, however, some
give their children low-country names, <i>e.g.</i>, R&#257;mudu,
Lachigadu, Arjanna, etc.</p>
<p>Males are, as a rule, burnt; but, if a person dies in the night or
on a rainy day, the corpse is sometimes buried. Women and children are
usually buried, presumably because they are not thought worth the fuel
necessary for cremation. Only relations are permitted to touch a
corpse. Death pollution is observed for three days, during which the
caste occupation must not be engaged in. Stone slabs are erected to the
memory of the dead, and sacrifices are offered to them now and
again.</p>
<p>The Gadabas have a devil dance, which they are willing to perform
before strangers in return for a small present. It has been thus
described by Captain Glasfurd.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6226src"

"pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>both men and women
dance to the music of a fife and drum. Sometimes they form a ring by
joining hands all round, and with a long hop spring towards the centre,
and then hop back to the full extent of their arms, while they at the
same time keep circling round and round. At other times, the women
dance singly or in pairs, their hands resting on each other&rsquo;s
wrists. When fatigued, they cease dancing, and sing. A man steps out of
the crowd, and sings a verse or two <i>impromptu</i>. One of the women
rejoins, and they sing at each other for a short time. The point of
these songs appears to consist in giving the sharpest rejoinder to each
other. The woman reflects upon the man&rsquo;s ungainly appearance and
want of skill as a cultivator or huntsman, and the man retorts by
reproaching her with her ugliness and slatternly habits.&rdquo; In
connection with dancing, Mr. Henderson writes that &ldquo;all the
Gadaba dancing I have seen was the same as that of the Porjas, and
consisted of a sort of women&rsquo;s march, at times accompanied by a
few men who wander round, and occasionally form a ring through which
the line of women passes. Sometimes the men get on each other&rsquo;s
shoulders, and so form a sort of two-storied pyramid. The women&rsquo;s
song is comparatively quite melodious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recent years, some Gadabas have emigrated to Assam, to work in
the tea-gardens. But emigration has now stopped by edict.</p>
<p>For the information contained in this article, I am mainly indebted
to notes by Mr. C. A. Henderson, Mr. W. Francis, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao,

<p><b>Gamalla.</b>&mdash;The Gamallas are a class of toddy-drawers, and
distillers and vendors of arrack in the Telugu country and are supposed
to be &#298;digas who have bettered themselves, and separated from that
caste. Both Gamallas and &#298;digas worship the deity K&#257;ttamayya.
At the census, 1891, some returned &#298;diga as their sub-division. In
the Cuddapah district some toddy-drawers style themselves
Asiliv&#257;ndlu. Possibly the &#298;diga, Gamalla, and Asili
toddy-drawing classes only represent three endogamous sections of a
single caste. In the Nellore district, the toddy-drawers style
themselves Gamandla or Gavandlav&#257;ndlu, and say that they have one
g&#333;tra Kaumandlapu or Gaumandlapu. It is probable that the name
Gamandla or Gavandla has been coined by Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hits, to
connect the caste with Kaumandala Mah&#257;rishi of the Pur&#257;nas.
The Gamallas say that they were created to draw toddy by the sage
Kavundinya, and that they belong to the Gaundla varnam (caste). I am
informed that a Pur&#257;nam, called Gamandla or Gamudi Pur&#257;nam,
has been created. In the social scale, the toddy-drawers appear to
occupy a higher position in the Telugu than in the Tamil country, and
they are sometimes said to be Telagas or Balijas, who have adopted
toddy-drawing as a profession. The more prosperous members of the
community are toddy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254"
name="pb254">254</a>]</span>and arrack (liquor) shop-keepers, and the
poorer members extract toddy from the palm-trees.</p>
<p>The K&#257;pus of the Nellore district employ Gamallas as their
cooks and domestic servants, and all menial service and cooking are
done by Gamallas in the houses of K&#257;pus on the occasion of
festivals and marriages.</p>
<p>Concerning the origin of the Gamallas, the following legend is
current. A Rishi was doing penance by standing on his head, and, like
the cham&aelig;leon, living on light and air, instead of food.
According to some, the Rishi was Kaumandla, while others do not know
his name. An &#298;diga girl passed by the Rishi, carrying a pot filled
with toddy, which polluted the air, so that the Rishi could not
continue the penance. Being struck with the girl&rsquo;s beauty, he
followed her to her home, and pointed out to her that she was the cause
of his mishap. He asked her to become his wife, but she announced that
she was already married. Eventually, however, they became secretly
united, and, in consequence, the whole town caught fire. The
girl&rsquo;s husband, returning home with some toddy, was amazed at the
sight, and she, to protect him, hid the Rishi in a vat. Into this vat
the husband poured the toddy, which made the Rishi breathe hard, so
that the toddy, for the first time on record, began to foam. Noticing
this, the husband found a lingam, into which the Rishi had been
transformed. This lingam was worshipped by the Gamandlas, and they are
at the present day Saivites.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the Gamallas have exogamous septs, such as
parvath&#257;la (hills), kudumalu (a cake), annam (cooked rice), and
pandhi (pig). Among g&#333;tras, the following may be
noted:&mdash;kavundinya, k&#257;runya, v&#257;chalya, and
sur&#257;p&#257;nd&#275;svara (sur&#257; p&#257;nda, toddy pot).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>Marriage is, as a rule, adult, and remarriage of widows is
permitted, though the tendency at the present day is to abandon the
practice. At the wedding of a widow, the bottu (marriage badge) is tied
round her neck at night. Prior to the marriage ceremony, the worship of
female ancestors must be performed. A new female cloth, betel, and
flowers, are placed on a tray, and worshipped by the mothers of the
contracting couple. The cloth is given as a present to a sister or
other near relation of the bride or bridegroom.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6287width" id="pl2-255"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Gamallas.</p>
</div>
<p>The dead are cremated, and the widow breaks one or two of her
bangles. Fire must be carried to the burning-ground by the father of
the deceased, if he is alive. On the day following cremation, the hot
embers are extinguished, and the ashes collected, and shaped into an
effigy, near the head of which three conical masses of mud and ashes
are set up. To these representatives of Rudra, Yama, and the spirit of
the departed, cooked rice and vegetables are offered up on three
leaves. One of the leaves is given to the Jangam, who officiates at the
rite, another to a washerman, and the third is left, so that the food
on it may be eaten by crows. All, who are assembled, wait till these
birds collect, and the ashes are finally poured on a tree. On the
ninth, tenth, or eleventh day after death, a ceremony called the
peddadinam (big day) is performed. Cooked rice, curry, meat, and other
things, are placed on a leaf inside the house. Sitting near this leaf,
the widow weeps and breaks one or two of the glass bangles, which she
wears on the wrist. The food is then taken to a stream or tank (pond),
where the agnates, after shaving, bathing, and purification, make an
effigy of the dead person on the ground. Close to this cooked rice and
vegetables are placed on three leaves, and offered to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>effigy. The widow&rsquo;s remaining bangles are
broken, and she is presented with a new cloth, called munda koka
(widow&rsquo;s cloth) as a sign of her condition. All Gamallas, rich or
poor, engage on this occasion the services of M&#257;la Pambalas and
Bain&#275;dus (musicians and story-tellers) to recite the story of the
goddess Ankamma. The performance is called Ankamma kolupu. Some of the
M&#257;las make on the ground a design, called muggu, while the others
play on the drum, and carry out the recitation. The design must be made
in five colours, green (leaves of <i>Cassia auriculata</i>), white
(rice flour), red (turmeric and lime), yellow (turmeric), and black
(burnt rice-husk). It represents a male and female figure (V&#299;rulu,
heroes), who are supposed to be the person whose peddadinam is being
celebrated, and an ancestor of the opposite sex. If the family can
afford it, other designs, for example of Ankamma, are also drawn. On
the completion of the muggu, cocoanuts, rice, and betel are offered,
and a fowl is sacrificed.</p>
<p>Like many other Telugu castes, the Gamallas have a class of beggars,
called Eneti, attached to them, for whom a subscription is raised when
they turn up.</p>
<p>The Gamallas are mostly Saivites, and their priests are
&#256;r&#257;dhya Br&#257;hmans, <i>i.e.</i>, Telugu Br&#257;hmans, who
have adopted some of the customs of the Ling&#257;yats. They worship a
variety of gods and goddesses, who include P&#333;thar&#257;ju,
K&#257;tamayya, Gangamma, Mathamma, and Thallamma, or Thadlamma. Once
or twice during the year, a pot of toddy is brought from every house to
the shrine of Thallamma, and the liquor contained in some of the pots
is poured on the floor, and the remainder given to those assembled,
irrespective of caste.</p>
<p>At the festival of D&#299;p&#257;vali, the celebrants bathe in the
early morning, and go, in wet clothes, to an ant-hill, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>before which they prostrate themselves, and pour
a little water into one of the holes. Round the hill they wind five
turns of cotton thread, and return home. Subsequently they come once
more to the ant-hill with a lamp made of flour paste. Carrying the
light, they go thrice or five times round the hill, and throw into a
hole therein split pulse (<i>Phaseolus Mungo</i>). During the whole of
this day they fast. On the following morning they again go to the hill,
pour milk into it, and snap the threads wound round it.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6314width" id="pl2-257"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Gamalla muggu.</p>
</div>
<p>At the festival of Sankar&#257;nthi, the principal member of every
family observes the worship of ancestors. Various articles are placed
in a room on leaf plates representing the ancestors, who are worshipped
by the celebrant after he has been purified by bathing. Taking a little
of the food from each leaf, he places it on a single leaf, which is
worshipped, and placed in the court-yard, so that the crows may partake
thereof. The remainder of the food is distributed among the members of
the family.</p>
<p>At the census, 1901, some Gamallas returned themselves as
Settig&#257;du (Chetti).</p>
<p><b>Gampa</b> (basket).&mdash;A sub-division of Kamma and Telaga, and
an exogamous sept of Odd&#275;. The name, among the Kammas, refers to a
deadly struggle at Gandik&#333;ta, in which some escaped by hiding in
baskets. Gampa dh&#333;mpti is the name of a sub-division of the
M&#257;digas, whose marriage offerings to the god are placed in a
basket.</p>
<p><b>Gan&#257;yata.</b>&mdash;Recorded, at times of census, as a
sub-division of Ling&#257;yat Jangams in the Nellore, Cuddapah, and
Kurnool districts. The Sanskrit word Ganam means Siva&rsquo;s
attendants.</p>
<p><b>Gandham</b> (sandal paste).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Balijas,
one sub-division of whom is called Gandhav&#257;llu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>or
Gandhapodi (sandal perfume sellers). The paste made by rubbing sandal
(<i>Santalum album</i>) wood on a stone with water is widely used in
connection with Hindu ceremonial observance. A Br&#257;hman, for
example, after worshipping, smears his body with the paste. At
festivals, and other ceremonial occasions, sandal paste is distributed
to guests along with betel leaves and areca nuts
(p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri). Gandhapodi also occurs as an exogamous sept of
B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Gandik&#333;ta.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Kamma. Gandi
K&#333;ttei is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6343src" href=
"#xd21e6343" name="xd21e6343src">7</a> as a sub-division of K&#257;pu
or Reddi, &ldquo;found only in Madura and Tinnevelly, and also known
simply as K&#333;ttei Reddis. K&#333;ttei is the Tamil for a fort, the
corresponding Telugu word being k&#333;ta. Their females do not appear
in public.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>G&#257;ndla.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> G&#257;niga.</p>
<p><b>Gangadik&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;Gangadik&#257;ra, said doubtfully to
mean those who lived on the banks of the Ganges, has been recorded as a
sub-division of the Holeyas, Okkiliyans, and Vakkaligas. The name
probably refers to Gangav&#257;di, the country of the Gangas, a royal
line which ruled over the greater part of the modern Mysore in former
times.</p>
<p><b>Gangeddu.</b>&mdash;The Gangeddulu are a class of mendicants, who
travel about the country exhibiting performing bulls. &ldquo;The
exhibition of sacred bulls, known as Gangeddulu (Ganga&rsquo;s bulls)
is very common in the towns and villages of Southern India. The
presence of the sw&#257;mi (god) bull, as he is popularly called, is
made known by his keeper playing on a small drum, which emits a dismal,
booming sound, in the intervals of addressing his dumb companion in a
piercing voice. The bull is led <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>about from house to house,
and made to go through several tricks, which he does with evident zest.
The keeper in the meanwhile talks to him, and puts questions to him, to
which he replies by shakes of his head. He will kneel down in an
attitude of worship, with his head inclined to the ground, or he will
approach you, and gently rub his nozzle against your hand. Usually a
diminutive cow accompanies the bull, and, like him, is grandly attired,
and resounds with tinkling bells. She is introduced to the spectators
as the bull&rsquo;s ammagaru, that is consort or spouse. Then a scene
between the pair is enacted, the gist of which is that the husband is
displeased with the wife, and declines to hold converse with her. As a
result of the difference, he resolves to go away, and stalks off in
high dudgeon. The keeper attempts to make peace between them, and is
rewarded by being charged by the irate husband and knocked down, though
no harm is done to him as the animal&rsquo;s horns are padded. The
keeper rises, shakes himself, and complains woefully of the treatment
he has received. Indeed, it is only after a great deal of coaxing and
wheedling, and promises of buying him endless quantities of rice cakes
and other bazaar delicacies, that the bull condescends to return, and a
reconciliation is effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The
Gangeddulu, Erud&#257;ndis, or Perum&#257;l M&#257;dukk&#257;rans,
often acquire and train deformed male calves. It is a popular
superstition that for a family to keep such animals in its possession
is to court destruction. Consequently, when one is born, information is
sent to a Gangeddu, who, on his arrival, is sumptuously fed. The calf
is then washed, and a new cloth tied to its horns. A small present of
money is made to the Gangeddu, and he takes the animal away. Temples
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>sometimes dispose of their deformed calves in a
similar manner. When the trained animals are exhibited in public, the
deformity, which is the hall-mark of a genuine Gangeddu, is shown,
usually at the commencement of the performance, or at any time at the
bidding of any of the spectators. It is only after the exhibition of
the deformity, which is usually concealed within the trappings of the
animal, that remuneration, generally in kind, or in old rags and copper
coins, is doled out to them. Villagers worship the bulls, when they
happen to pass their houses, and, as soon as they enter a village, the
females wash the feet of the animals with milk and water. They then
adorn their foreheads with kunkumam (aniline powder) and turmeric
paste, and burn incense and camphor before them. Cocoanuts, plantains,
betel leaves and areca nuts, and money are also offered in a plate, and
are the perquisite of the Gangeddu. The bulls are thus venerated, as
they represent Basavanna, the sacred bull which is the vehicle of
Siva.</p>
<p>The language of the Gangeddulu is Telugu, but those who have
migrated to the Tamil country also speak the language of the south.
They profess the Vaishnavite religion, and are of the Tengalai
persuasion. They have Br&#257;hman gurus (religious preceptors), who
reside at Srirangam, Tirupati, and other places. By them the Gangeddulu
are branded on the shoulder with the emblems of the chank and chakram,
and initiated into the mysteries of the D&#257;sari priesthood. But,
though they call themselves D&#257;saris, the Gangeddulu have no
marital or other connection with the D&#257;saris. In addition to
training and exhibiting the performing bulls and cultivating land, the
Gangeddulu officiate as D&#257;saris in the month of Perat&#257;si
(September-October). Their principal insignia of office are the chank
shell, which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>blown to announce their arrival, and the
iron lamp (called Garudasthambha), which is kept burning, and is said
to represent Venkat&#275;sa, the presiding deity at Tirupati. As
D&#257;saris, little is expected of them, except offering fruits to the
god, and assisting at funerals. Several proverbs, of which the
following are examples, are current concerning this aspect of their
life:&mdash;</p>
<p>The mistake of a D&#257;sari is excused with an apology.</p>
<p>The songs of a D&#257;sari are known only to the god, <i>i.e.</i>,
they are unintelligible and unreal.</p>
<p>For the song of a D&#257;sari alms are the payment, <i>i.e.</i>,
that is all the song is worth.</p>
<p>Sing again what you have sung, oh! D&#257;sari with dirty teeth.</p>
<p>When a beggar was asked whether he was a D&#257;sari or a Jangam, he
replied that it depends on the next village. This in reference to his
being a time-server.</p>
<p>A Gangeddu mendicant is, like his bulls, picturesquely attired. He
is very punctilious about having his sect-mark on the forehead,
invariably wears a turban, and his body is clothed in a long white
cloth robe. When going about with the performing bulls, the Gangeddulu
generally travel in pairs, one carrying a drum, and the other a
bell-metal gong. One of them holds in one hand the nose-rope of the
bull, and in the other the whip. The bulls are dressed up in a patch
work quilt with two eye-holes in it. Of names which are given to the
animals, R&#257;ma and Lakshmana are very popular. The tameness of the
bulls is referred to in the proverb &ldquo;As mild as a
Gangeddu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Perum&#257;l M&#257;dukk&#257;rans, or Perum&#257;l
Erudukk&#257;rans, both of which names indicate those who lead bulls
about, are found chiefly in the Chingleput, North and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>South Arcot districts. &ldquo;Every now and
then,&rdquo; Mr. S. M. Natesa Sastri writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6395src" href="#xd21e6395" name="xd21e6395src">8</a>
&ldquo;throughout Madras, a man dressed up as a buffoon is to be seen
leading about a bull, as fantastically got up as himself with cowries
(<i>Cypr&aelig;a arabica</i> shells) and rags of many colours, from
door to door. The bull is called in Tamil Perum&#257;l erudu, and in
Telugu Ganga eddu, the former meaning Vishnu&rsquo;s bull and the
latter Ganga&rsquo;s bull. The origin of the first is given in a
legend, but that of the last is not clear. The conductors of these
bulls are neatherds of high caste, called P&#363; Idaiyan, <i>i.e.</i>,
flower neatherds (<i>see</i> Idaiyan), and come from villages in the
North and South Arcot districts. They are a simple and ignorant set,
who firmly believe that their occupation arises out of a command from
the great god Venkat&#257;chalapati, the lord of the Venkat&#257;chala
near Tirupaddi (Tirupati) in the North Arcot district. Their legend is
as follows. Among the habitual gifts to the Venkat&#257;chala temple at
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6408" title=
"Source: Tiruppadi">Tirupaddi</span> were all the freaks of nature of
the neighbourhood as exhibited in cattle, such as two-tailed cows,
five-legged bulls, four-horned calves, and so on. The P&#363; Idaiyans,
whose original duty was to string flowers for the temple, were set to
graze these abortions. Now to graze cows is an honour, but to tend such
creatures as these the P&#363; Idaiyans regarded as a sin. So they
prayed to Venkat&#257;chalapati to show them how they could purge it
away. On this, the god gave them a bull called after himself the
Perum&#257;l bull and said: &lsquo;My sons, if you take as much care of
this bull as you would of your own children, and lead it from house to
house, begging its food, your sin will be washed away.&rsquo; Ever
since then they have been purging themselves of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>original sin. The process is this. The bull
leader takes it from house to house, and puts it questions, and the
animal shakes its head in reply. This is proof positive that it can
reason. The fact is the animal is bought when young for a small sum,
and brought up to its profession. Long practice has made its purchasers
experts in selecting the animals that will suit them. After purchase
the training commences, which consists in pinching the animal&rsquo;s
ears whenever it is given bran, and it soon learns to shake its head at
the sight of bran. I need hardly say that a handful of bran is ready in
its conductor&rsquo;s hands when the questions are put to it. It is
also taught to butt at any person that speaks angrily to it. As regards
the offerings made to these people, one-sixth goes to feeding the
bulls, and the remaining five-sixths to the conductors. They look upon
it as &lsquo;good work&rsquo;, but the village boys and girls think it
the greatest fun in the world to watch its performances, and the advent
of a Vishnu&rsquo;s bull is hailed by the youngsters with the greatest
delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Gangimakkalu.</b>&mdash;Gangimakkalu, or Gangaputra, meaning
children or sons of Ganga, the goddess of water, is the name of a
sub-division of Kabb&#275;ra. The allied Gangavamsamu, or people of
Ganga, is a name for J&#257;l&#257;ris.</p>
<p><b>G&#257;niga or G&#257;ndla.</b>&mdash;The name G&#257;niga is
derived from the Telugu g&#257;nuga, meaning an oil-mill. The
G&#257;nigas are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6421src" href=
"#xd21e6421" name="xd21e6421src">9</a> to be &ldquo;the oil pressers of
the Canarese people, corresponding to the Telugu G&#257;ndla and the
Tamil V&#257;niyan. This caste is sub-divided into three sections, none
of whom eat together or intermarry. These sections are the
Hegg&#257;nigas, who yoke two oxen to a stone oil-mill;
Kirg&#257;nigas, who make oil in wooden <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>mills; and Ontiyeddu
G&#257;nigas, who yoke only one animal to the mill. They are
collectively known as J&#333;tipans or J&#333;tinagarams (people of the
city of light). In addition to pressing oil, they also make palm-leaf
umbrellas, cultivate land, and work as labourers. They employ
Br&#257;hmans to perform their ceremonies. Their guru is the head of
the Vy&#257;sar&#257;ya mutt at &#256;negundi. Early marriage is
practiced. Widow remarriage is not allowed. They eat fish, mutton, and
fowls, but do not drink liquor. Chetti is their title.&rdquo; In the
Madras Census Report, 1891, it is stated that the guru of the
G&#257;nigas is the head of the mutt at Sringeri, and that they employ
Havig Br&#257;hmans for their ceremonies. Sringeri is the name of a
Smarta (Saivite) mutt or religious institution at several places, such
as Tanjore and Kumbak&#333;nam; and there is a town of this name in
Mysore, from which the mutt derives its name.</p>
<p>Concerning the G&#257;nigas of the Mysore Province, Mr. V. N.
Narasimmiyengar writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6428src"
href="#xd21e6428" name="xd21e6428src">10</a> &ldquo;The account locally
obtained connects this caste with the Nagart&#257;s, as forming the
leading communities of the left-hand faction, in opposition to the
Lingayats and other castes composing the right-hand faction. Caste
supremacy is ever associated in India with preternatural mythology. If
the average Br&#257;hman traces his nobility literally to the face of
Brahma, according to the V&#275;dic Purusha S&#363;kta, every other
castelet claims a patent of superiority in a similar miraculous origin.
The G&#257;nigas allege that they immigrated from the north at a time
beyond living memory. A Mysore noble, named Mallar&#257;je Ars,
established and first peopled the p&#275;te (market town) of Bangalore,
when the G&#257;nigas first came there, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>followed by the
Nagart&#257;s, who are said to have been co-emigrants with the
G&#257;nigas. Mallar&#257;j made Sattis and Yajam&#257;ns (headmen) of
the principal members of the two castes, and exempted them from the
house-tax. The G&#257;nigas are both Vaishnavites and Saivites. Their
guru is known as Dharmasiv&#257;ch&#257;rsv&#257;mi in the Madras
Presidency, and certain g&#333;tras (family names) are said to be
common to the G&#257;nigas and Nagart&#257;s, but they never eat
together or intermarry. The G&#257;nigas claim the peculiar privilege
of following the Vishnu image or car processions, throughout the
province, with flags exhibiting the figures of Hanum&#257;n and Garuda,
and torches. These insignia are alleged to have been aboriginally given
to an ancestor, named Siriy&#257;la Satti, by R&#257;ma, as a reward
for a valuable gem presented by him. The G&#257;nigas call themselves
Dharmasiv&#257;ch&#257;r Vaisy&#257;s like the Nagart&#257;s, and the
feud between them used often to culminate in much bitter
unpleasantness. The order includes a small division of the
linga-wearing oilmongers, known as Sajjan&#257; (good men), whose
population is a small fraction of the community. The Sajjan&#257;s,
however, hold no social intercourse of any kind with the other
sub-divisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The G&#257;nigas of Sand&#363;r, in the little Mar&#257;tha State of
that name, returned Yenne (oil) and Kallu (stone) as sub-divisions. The
average cephalic index of these G&#257;nigas was very high, being 80.5
as against 77.6 for the G&#257;nigas of Mysore city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The oil-mill of the G&#257;nigas is,&rdquo; Mr. W. Francis
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6437src" href="#xd21e6437" name=
"xd21e6437src">11</a> &ldquo;a sort of large wooden mortar, usually
formed out of the heart of a tamarind tree, and firmly imbedded in the
ground. A wooden cylinder, shod with iron, fits <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>roughly into the cavity. A cross beam is lashed
to this in such a way that one end is close to the ground, and to this
a pair of bullocks or buffaloes are fastened. By an arrangement of
pullies, the pressure of the cylinder can be increased at pleasure. As
the bullocks go round the trough, the seeds are crushed by the action
of the cylinder, so that the expressed oil falls to the bottom, while
the residuum, as oil-cake, adheres to the side of the
mortar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following note refers to the Onteddu (single bullock)
G&#257;nigas, who claim superiority over those who employ two bullocks
in working their oil-mills. The former belong to the right-hand, and
the latter to the left-hand faction. Among them are various
sub-divisions, of which the D&#275;va and Onteddu may intermarry, while
the Kasi, Teli (gingelly: <i>Sesamum</i>), and Chandanapu are
endogamous. Like other Telugu castes they have g&#333;tras, some of
which are interesting, as there are certain prohibitions connected with
them. For example, members of the Badranollu and Balanollu g&#333;tras
may not cut the tree <i>Erythroxylon monogynum</i>. In like manner,
members of the V&#299;ranollu and Viththanollu g&#333;tras are
forbidden to cut <i>Feronia elephantum</i>, and those of the
V&#275;danollu g&#333;tra to cut <i>Nyctanthes arbor-tristis</i>.
Members of certain other g&#333;tras do not cultivate turmeric,
sugarcane, or the millet (<i>Panicum miliare</i>).</p>
<p>The Onteddu G&#257;nigas are Saivites, and disciples of
Ling&#257;yat Br&#257;hmans (&#256;r&#257;dhyas). Some, however, wear
the sacred thread, and others bear on the forehead the red streak of
the Vaishnavites. In some places, their special deity is Chaudeswara,
who is the god of some of the weaving classes. In the Kistna district
they claim Mallik&#257;rjunasv&#257;mi as their deity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their primary occupation is oil-pressing, but some are traders in
cotton, oil-seeds, etc., or cultivators. In some localities, the animal
which works the oil-mill is not blindfolded, while it is in others,
because, it is said, it would otherwise fall down after a few
revolutions. Crushing gingelly oil is, according to the Sh&#257;stras,
a sinful act, but condoned inasmuch as D&#275;vatas use this oil for
lamps, and men in temples. For the removal of the oil-cake, or turning
the seeds in the mill, the left hand only is used. Burning the tongue
with a piece of gold, as a means of purification after some offence has
been committed, is a common practice.</p>

</div>
<p>The marriage rites conform, for the most part, to the Telugu type.
But, while the wrist thread is being tied on, common salt is held in
the hand. A dagger (b&#257;ku) is then given to the bridegroom, who
keeps it with him till the conclusion of the ceremonies. On the wedding
day, the bridegroom wears the sacred thread. The t&#257;li is not an
ordinary bottu, but a thread composed of 101 thin strings, which is
removed on the last day, and replaced by a bottu. On the third day, the
bride and bridegroom worship a jammi tree (<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>),
and the latter, removing his sacred thread, throws it on the tree. Five
young men, called B&#257;la D&#257;sulu, also worship the tree, and, if
they are wearing the sacred thread, throw it thereon. The dead are as a
rule buried, in a sitting posture if the deceased was an orthodox
Saivite. If a young man dies a bachelor, the corpse is married to an
arka plant (<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>), and decorated with a wreath
made of the flowers thereof. The final death ceremonies are performed
on the eleventh day. Food is offered to crows and the soul of the dead
person, who is represented by a wooden post dressed with his clothes.
The bangles of a widow are broken <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268"

finally thrown into a tank or stream.</p>
<p>G&#257;niga further occurs as an occupational name for Ling&#257;yat
oil-vendors, and for Mogers who are employed as oil-pressers.</p>
<p><b>Ganta.</b>&mdash;Ganta or Gantla, meaning a bell, has been
recorded as an exogamous sept of Kamma and Balija. Gantelav&#257;ru, or
men of the bell, is given by Mr. S. M. Natesa Sastri<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6486src" href="#xd21e6486" name="xd21e6486src">12</a> as the
family name of one section of the Donga (thieving) D&#257;saris, and of
the Kabb&#275;ras, who are said to join the ranks of this criminal
class. Gantug&#257;zula occurs, in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, as a
sub-division of Koracha. In the Vizagapatam Manual, the Tiragati
Gantlavallu are described as repairing hand-mills, catching antelopes,
and selling their skins.</p>
<p><b>Ganti</b> (a hole pierced in the ear-lobe).&mdash;An exogamous
sept of G&#363;dala.</p>
<p><b>G&#257;radi.</b>&mdash;G&#257;radi or G&#257;radiga is the name
of a class of mendicants in the Telugu country and Mysore who are
snake-charmers, practice sleight of hand, and perform various juggling
and mountebank tricks.</p>
<p><b>Garappa</b> (dry land).&mdash;A synonym of Challa
Y&#257;n&#257;di.</p>
<p><b>Gatti.</b>&mdash;A small caste of cultivators, found chiefly near
Kumbla and Someswara in the Kasaragod t&#257;luk of South Canara. Other
names for the caste are Poladava and Holadava, both signifying men of
the field. Like the Bants, they follow the aliya sant&#257;na law of
inheritance (in the female line), have exogamous septs or balis, and,
on the day of the final death ceremonies, construct car-like
structures, if the deceased was an important personage in the
community. The Bants and Gattis interdine, but do not intermarry. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=

The God of the Someswara temple is regarded as the caste deity, and
every family has to pay an annual fee of four annas to this temple.
Failure to do so would entail excommunication.</p>
<p><b>Gattu</b> (bank or mound).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Gaud.</b>&mdash;A title of S&#257;dar.</p>
<p><b>Gauda.</b>&mdash;The Gaudas or Gaudos are a large caste of
Canarese cultivators and cattle-breeders. &ldquo;Gauda and
Gaudo,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6519src" href="#xd21e6519" name="xd21e6519src">13</a> &ldquo;are
really two distinct castes, the former being Canarese and the latter
Uriya. Each name is, however, spelt both ways. The two names are, I
presume, etymologically the same. The ordinary derivation is from the
Sanskrit go, a cow, but Dr. Gustav Oppert contends<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6524src" href="#xd21e6524" name="xd21e6524src">14</a> that the
root of Gauda is a Dravidian word meaning a mountain. Among the
Canarese, and to a less extent among the Uriyas also, the word is used
in an honorific sense, a custom which is difficult to account for if
Dr. Oppert&rsquo;s philology is correct.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gaudas,&rdquo;
Mr. Stuart writes further,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6527src" href=
"#xd21e6527" name="xd21e6527src">15</a> &ldquo;also called
H&#257;lvaklumakkalu (children of the milk class), are very numerously
represented in the South Canara district. They have a somewhat
elaborate system of caste government. In every village there are two
headmen, the Gr&#257;ma Gauda and the Vattu or Gattu Gauda. For every
group of eight or nine villages there is another head called the
M&#257;gan&#275; Gauda, and for every nine M&#257;gan&#275;s there is a
yet higher authority called the Katt&#275;man&#275;yava. The caste is
divided into eighteen baris or balis, which are of the usual exogamous
character. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>The names of some of these are as follows:
Bang&#257;ra (gold), Nandara, Mal&#257;ra (a bundle of glass bangles,
as carried about for sale), S&#257;lu, Hemmana (pride or conceit),
Kabru, G&#333;li (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, a pot-herb),
Basruv&#333;garu (basru, belly), Balasanna, and Karmann&#257;ya.
Marriage is usually adult, and sexual license before marriage with a
member of the caste is tolerated, though nominally condemned. The
dh&#257;r&#275; form of marriage (<i>see</i> Bant) is used, but the
bridal pair hold in their joined hands five betel leaves, one areca nut
and four annas, and, after the water has been poured, the bridegroom
ties a t&#257;li to the neck of the bride. Divorce is permitted freely,
and divorced wives and widows can marry again. A widow with children,
however, should marry only her late husband&rsquo;s elder brother. If
she marries any one else, the members of her former husband&rsquo;s
family will not even drink water that has been touched by her. They
burn their dead. On the third day, the ashes are made into the form of
a man, which is cut in two, buried, and a mound made over it. In the
house two planks are placed on the ground, and covered with a cloth. On
one of these, a vessel containing milk is placed, and on the other a
lamp, rice, cocoanut, pumpkin, etc., are deposited. The agnates and
some boys go round the plank three times, and afterwards go to the
mound, taking with them the various articles in a cloth. Three plantain
leaves are spread in front of the mound, and cooked food, etc., placed
thereon. Four posts are set up round the mound, and cloths stretched
over them, and placed round the sides. On the sixteenth day, sixteen
plantain leaves are placed in a row, and one leaf is laid apart. Cakes,
cooked fowl&rsquo;s flesh, toddy and arrack (liquor) are placed on the
leaves in small leaf-cups. The assembled agnates then say &ldquo;We
have done everything as we should do, and so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>our
ancestors who have died must take the man who is now dead to their
regions. I put the leaf which is apart in the same row with the sixteen
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once a year, in the month of Mituna (June-July), the Gaudas
perform a ceremony for the propitiation of all deceased ancestors. They
have a special preference for Venkatar&#257;masw&#257;mi, to whom they
make money offerings once a year in September. They employ
Br&#257;hmins to give them sacred water when they are under pollution,
but they do not seek their services for ordinary ceremonies. They are,
for the most part, farmers, but some few are labourers. The latter
receive three or four seers of paddy a day as wages. Their house
language is Tulu in some places, and Canarese in others, but all follow
the ordinary system of inheritance, and not the custom of descent
through females. Their title is Gauda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As bearing on the superstitious beliefs of the people of South
Canara, the following case, which was tried before the Sessions Judge
in 1908, may be cited. A young Gauda girl became pregnant by her
brother-in-law. After three days&rsquo; labour, the child was born. The
accused, who was the mother of the girl, was the midwife. Finding the
delivery very difficult, she sent for a person named Korapulu to come
and help her. The child was, as they thought, still-born. On its head
was a red protuberance like a ball; round each of its forearms were two
or three red bands; the eyes and ears were fixed very high in the head;
and the eyes, nose, and mouth were abnormally large. Korapulu and the
girl&rsquo;s younger sister at once carried the mother out of the
out-house lest the devil child should do her harm or kill her. The
accused called for a man named Isuf Saiba, who was standing in the yard
outside. He came in, and she asked him to call some of the neighbours,
to decide <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>what to do. The child, she said, was a devil
child, and must be cut and killed, lest it should devour its mother.
While they were looking at the child, it began to move and roll its
eyes about, and turn on the ground. It is a belief of the villagers
that such a devil child, when born and brought in contact with the air,
rapidly grows, and causes great trouble, usually killing the mother,
and sometimes killing all the inmates of the house. The accused told
Isuf Saiba to cover the child with a vessel, which he did. Then there
was a sound from inside the vessel, either of the child moving or
making some sound with its mouth. The accused then put her hand under
the vessel, dragged the child half way out, and then, while Isuf Saiba
pressed the edge of the earthenware vessel on the abdomen of the child,
the accused took a knife, and cut the body in half. When the body was
cut in two, there was no blood, but a mossy green liquid, or a black
liquid, oozed out. The accused got two areca leaves, and put one piece
of the child on one, and one on the other, and told Isuf Saiba to get a
spade, and come and bury them. So they went out into the jungle close
to the house, and Isuf Saiba dug two holes about half a yard deep, one
on one hillock, and one on another. In these two holes the two pieces
of the child were separately buried. The object of this was to prevent
the two pieces joining together again, in which case the united devil
child would have come out of the grave, and gone to kill its mother.
The birth and death of this devil child were not kept secret, but were
known throughout the village.</p>
<p>Gauda or Gaudu further occurs as a title of &#298;diga, Kuruba, and
Vakkaliga, an exogamous sept and g&#333;tra of Kuruba and Kurni, and a
sub-division of Golla.</p>
<p><b>Gaudi.</b>&mdash;It is recorded, in the Mysore Census Report,
1901, that a Maleru (temple servant) woman, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>who
cohabits with one of a lower class than her own, is degraded into a
Gaudi.</p>
<p><b>Gaudo.</b>&mdash;The Gaudos are described, in the Madras Census
Reports, 1891 and 1901, as &ldquo;the great pastoral caste of the
Ganjam Oriyas. Like those of all the cowherd classes, its members say
that they are descended from the Y&#257;dava tribe, in which Krishna
was born (<i>cf.</i> Idaiyan). The majority of the Gaudos in the
northern districts are now cultivators, but there is evidence that the
keeping and breeding of cattle is their traditional occupation. The
most important sub-division is Sollokhondia; many of them are herdsmen
and milk-sellers. Fourteen sub-divisions have been reported. They are
Apoto, B&#275;hara, Bolodiya, Dong&#257;yato, Dum&#257;lo,
G&#333;popuriya, Kol&#257;ta, Komiriya, Kusilya, L&#257;dia,
Madhur&#257;purya, Mogotho, Pattilia, and Sollokhondia.&rdquo; In the
Census Report, 1871, it is noted that &ldquo;there are many Gowdus of
high social standing, who have gotten unto themselves much wealth in
cattle. These men own, in many instances, large herds of buffaloes,
which, being reared in the boundless pastures of the hills, are much
prized by the cartmen of the low country for draught
purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the sub-division noted above, B&#275;hara is apparently a title
only. Bolodiya is the name of a section of the Tellis, who use
pack-bullocks (bolodi, a bull) for carrying grain about the country.
Pattilia must be a mistake for Pachilia. The sections among the Gaudos
which are recognised by all castes in the Ganjam district are
Sollokhondia, Bhatta, G&#333;popuriya, Madhur&#257;puriya, Mogotho,
Apoto, and Pachilia. These, with the exception of G&#333;popuriya and
Madhur&#257;puriya, seem to be endogamous sub-divisions. The Bhatta
Gaudos go by the name of G&#333;popuriya in some places and
Madhur&#257;puriya in others, both these names being connected with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>the legendary history of the origin of the
caste. The Apoto and Bhatta Gaudos are sometimes employed as
palanquin-bearers. The Mogotho Gaudos, who live on the hills, are
regarded as an inferior section, because they do not abstain from
eating fowls. The Sollokhondia section is regarded as superior, and
consequently all Oriya castes, Br&#257;hman and non-Br&#257;hman, will
accept water at the hands of members thereof. An orthodox Oriya
non-Br&#257;hman, and all Oriya Br&#257;hmans, will not receive water
from Telugu or Tamil Br&#257;hmans, whom they call Komma Br&#257;hmans,
Komma being a corrupt form of karma, <i>i.e.</i>, Br&#257;hmans who are
strict in the observance of the various karmas (ceremonial rites).</p>
<p>The Sollokhondia Gaudos are agriculturists, rear cattle and sheep,
and sometimes earn a living by driving carts. They have g&#333;tras,
among which the most common are Moiro (peacock), N&#257;gasiro (cobra),
and Kochimo (tortoise). Their caste council is presided over by a
hereditary headman called Mah&#257;nkudo, who is assisted by a
Bhollobaya, Desiya, and Khorsodha or Dhondia. The Khorsodha is the
caste servant, and the Desiya eats with a delinquent who is received
back into the fold after he has been tried by the council. The
Sollokhondias are for the most part Paramarthos, <i>i.e.</i>, followers
of the Chaitanya form of Vaishnavism. They show a partiality for the
worship of Jagann&#257;thasw&#257;mi, and various T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities) are also reverenced. Bair&#257;gis are the caste
priests.</p>
<p>The marriage prohibitions among the Sollokhondias are those which
hold good among many Oriya castes, but marriage with the maternal
uncle&rsquo;s daughter (m&#275;narikam) is sometimes practiced. On the
evening preceding the marriage day (bibha), after a feast, the bride
and bridegroom&rsquo;s parties go to a temple, taking with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>them
all the articles which are to be used in connection with the marriage
ceremonial. On their way back, seven married girls, carrying seven
vessels, go to seven houses, and beg water, which is used by the bridal
couple for their baths on the following day. Either on the day before
the wedding day, or on the bibha day, the bridegroom is shaved, and the
bride&rsquo;s nails are pared. Sometimes a little of the hair of her
forehead is also cut off. The marriage rites do not materially differ
from those of the Bhond&#257;ris (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>
<p>The dead, excepting young children, are burnt. The eldest son
carries a pot of fire to the burning ground. On the day following
cremation, the mourners revisit the spot, and, after the fire has been
extinguished, make an image of a man with the ashes on the spot where
the corpse was burnt. To this image food is offered. Seven small flags,
made of cloths dyed with turmeric, are stuck into the shoulders,
abdomen, legs, and head of the image. A fragment of calcined bone is
carried away, put into a lump of cow-dung, and kept near the house of
the deceased, or near a tank (pond). On the ninth day after death,
towards evening, a bamboo, split or spliced into four at one end, is
set up in the ground outside the house beneath the projecting roof, and
on it a pot filled with water is placed. On the spot where the deceased
breathed his last, a lamp is kept. A hole is made in the bottom of the
pot, and, after food has been offered to the dead man, the pot is
thrown into a tank. On the tenth day, a ceremony is performed on a tank
bund (embankment). The piece of bone, which has been preserved, is
removed from its cow-dung case, and food, fruits, etc., are offered to
it, and thrown into the tank. The bone is taken home, and buried near
the house, food being offered to it until the twelfth day. On
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>the eleventh day, all the agnates bathe, and are
touched with gh&#299; (clarified butter) as a sign of purification.
Sr&#257;dh (memorial service) is performed once a year on
Sankar&#257;nthi (Pongal) day. Food, in the form of balls, is placed on
leaves in the backyard, and offered to the ancestors. Some food is also
thrown up into the air.</p>
<p>All sections of the Gaudos have adopted infant marriage. If a girl
fails to secure a husband before she attains puberty, she has to go
through a form of marriage called dharma bibha, in which the bridegroom
is, among the Sollokhondias, represented by an old man, preferably the
girl&rsquo;s grandfather, and among the other sections by a sah&#257;da
or sh&#257;di tree (<i>Streblus asper</i>) or an arrow (khando).</p>
<p>Like various other Oriya castes, the Gaudos worship the goddess
Lakshmi on Thursdays in the month of November, which are called Lakshmi
varam, or Lakshmi&rsquo;s day. The goddess is represented by a basket
filled with grain, whereon some place a hair ball, which has been
vomited by a cow. The ball is called g&#257;ya panghula, and is usually
one or two inches in diameter. The owner of a cow which has vomited
such a ball regards it as a propitious augury for the prosperity of his
family. A feast is held on the day on which the ball is vomited, and,
after the ball has been worshipped, it is carefully wrapped up, and
kept in a box, in which it remains till it is required for further
worship. Some people believe that the ball continues to grow year by
year, and regard this as a very good sign. Bulls are said not to vomit
the balls, and only very few cows do so.</p>

an important sub-division of K&#333;matis (traders), and these Gavaras
are probably in reality Gavara K&#333;matis. These are so called after
Gauri, the patron deity of this caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. A
tradition is current that the Gavaras originally lived at V&#275;ngi,
the ancient capital of the Eastern Ch&#257;lukyan kings, the ruins of
which are near Ellore in the God&#257;vari district. The king was
desirous of seeing one of their women, who was g&#333;sha (in
seclusion), but to this they would not consent. Under orders from the
king, their houses were set on fire. Some of them bolted themselves in,
and perished bravely, while others locked up their women in big boxes,
and escaped with them to the coast. They immediately set sail, and
landed at P&#363;dimadaka in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>Anak&#257;palli t&#257;luk.
Thence they marched as far as Kondakirla, near which they founded the
village of W&#257;dapalli or W&#333;dapalli, meaning the village of the
people who came in boats. They then built another village called
Gavarla Anak&#257;palli. They received an invitation from king
P&#257;yaka Rao, the founder of Anak&#257;palli, and, moving
northwards, established themselves at what is now known as
Gavarap&#275;ta in the town of Anak&#257;palli. They began the
foundation of the village auspiciously by consecrating and planting the
sandra karra (<i>Acacia sundra</i>), which is not affected by
&lsquo;white-ants,&rsquo; instead of the p&#257;la karra (<i>Mimusops
hexandra</i>), which is generally used for this purpose. Consequently,
Anak&#257;palli has always flourished.</p>
<p>The Gavaras speak Telugu, and, like other Telugu castes, have
various exogamous septs or intip&#275;rulu.</p>
<p>Girls are married either before or after puberty. The custom of
m&#275;narikam, by which a man marries his maternal uncle&rsquo;s
daughter, is in force, and it is said that he may also marry his
sister&rsquo;s daughter. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and a
woman who has had seven husbands is known as Beththamma, and is much
respected.</p>
<p>Some Gavaras are Vaishnavites, and others Saivites, but difference
in religion is no bar to intermarriage. Both sections worship the
village deities, to whom animal sacrifices are offered. The
Vaishnavites show special reverence to Jaggan&#257;thasw&#257;mi of
Orissa, whose shrine is visited by some, while others take vows in the
name of this god. On the day on which the car festival is celebrated at
P&#363;ri, local car festivals are held in Gavara villages, and women
carry out the performance of their vows. A woman, for example, who is
under a vow, in order that she may be cured of illness or bear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>children, takes a big pot of water, and, placing
it on her head, dances frantically before the god, through whose
influence the water, which rises out of the pot, falls back into it,
instead of being spilt.</p>
<p>The Vaishnavites are burnt, and the Saivites buried in a sitting
posture. The usual chinna (little) and pedda r&#333;zu (big day) death
ceremonies are performed.</p>
<p>Men wear a gold bangle on the left wrist, and another on the right
arm. Women wear a silver bangle on the right wrist, and a bracelet of
real or imitation coral, which is first worn at the time of marriage,
on the left wrist. They throw the end of their body-cloth over the left
shoulder. They do not, like women of other non-Br&#257;hman castes in
the Vizagapatam district, smoke cigars.</p>
<p>The original occupation of the caste is said to have been trading,
and this may account for the number of exogamous septs which are named
after Settis (traders). At the present day, the Gavaras are
agriculturists, and they have the reputation of being very
hard-working, and among the best agriculturists in the Vizagapatam
district. The women travel long distances in order to sell vegetables,
milk, curds, and other produce.</p>
<p>The caste titles are Anna, Ayya, and occasionally N&#257;yudu.</p>
<p><b>G&#257;ya</b> (cow).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kondra.</p>
<p><b>Gayinta.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as a small caste of hill cultivators, speaking Oriya and Telugu. The
name is said to be derived from gayinti, an iron digging implement.
Gayinta is reported to be the same as Gaintia, a name of En&#275;tis or
Entamaras.</p>
<p><b>G&#257;zula.</b>&mdash;G&#257;zula or Gazul (glass bangle) has
been recorded as a sub-division of Balija, K&#257;pu, and Toreya. The
G&#257;zula Balijas make glass bangles. The Toreyas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>have
a tradition that they originated from the bangles of Machyagandhi, the
daughter of a fisherman on the Jumna, who was married to king Shantanu
of Hastinap&#363;r.</p>
<p><b>G&#275;dala</b> (buffaloes).&mdash;A sept of Bonthuk Savara.</p>
<p><b>Geddam</b> (beard).&mdash;An exogamous sept of B&#333;ya and
Padma S&#257;l&#275;.</p>
<p><b>Gejjala</b> (bells tied to the legs while dancing).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of Balija and Korava.</p>
<p><b>Gejj&#275;g&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;A sub-caste of the Canarese
P&#257;nch&#257;las. They are described, in the Mysore Census Report,
1891, as makers of small round bells (gungru), which are used for
decorating the head or neck of bullocks, and tied by dancing-girls
round their ankles when dancing.</p>
<p><b>Genn&#275;ru</b> (sweet-scented oleander).&mdash;An exogamous
sept of B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Gentoo.</b>&mdash;Gentoo or Jentu, as returned at times of
census, is stated to be a general term applied to Balijas and Telugu
speaking S&#363;dras generally. The word is said by Yule and
Burnell<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6691src" href="#xd21e6691" name=
"xd21e6691src">16</a> to be &ldquo;a corruption of the Portuguese
Gentio, a gentile or heathen, which they applied to the Hindus in
contradistinction to the Moros or Moors, <i>i.e.</i>, Mahomedans. The
reason why the term became specifically applied to the Telugu people is
probably because, when the Portuguese arrived, the Telugu monarchy of
Vijayanagar was dominant over a great part of the peninsula.&rdquo; In
a letter written from prison to Sir Philip Francis, R&#257;jah Nuncomar
referred to the fact that &ldquo;among the English gentry, Armenians,
Moores and Gentoos, few there is who is not against me.&rdquo; Gentoo
still survives as a caste name in the Madras Quarterly Civil List
(1906). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=

<p><b>Ghair-i-Mahd&#299;.</b>&mdash;The name, meaning without
Mahd&#299;, of a sect of Muhammadans, who affirm that the Im&#257;m
Mahd&#299; has come and gone, while orthodox Muhammadans hold that he
is yet to come.</p>
<p><b>Gh&#257;si.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Haddi.</p>
<p><b>Ghontoro.</b>&mdash;A small caste of Oriyas, who manufacture
brass and bell-metal rings and bangles for the hill people. The name is
derived from ghonto, a bell-metal plate.</p>
<p><b>Gidda</b> (vulture).&mdash;A sept of Poroja.</p>
<p><b>Gikkili</b> (rattle).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.</p>
<p><b>Giri R&#257;zu.</b>&mdash;A contraction of Puragiri R&#257;zu or
Puragiri Kshatriya, by which names some Perikes style themselves.</p>
<p><b>Goa.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Kudubis, who are said to have
emigrated from Goa to South Canara.</p>
<p><b>G&#333; Br&#257;hman.</b>&mdash;A name given to Br&#257;hmans by
Kamm&#257;lans, who style themselves Visva Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;dagula.</b>&mdash;The G&#333;dagulas are recorded, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as being the same as the G&#363;dalas, who
are a Telugu caste of basket-makers. According to Mr. C. Hayavadana
Rao, to whom I am indebted for the following note, they are a distinct
caste, speaking Oriya, and sometimes calling themselves Odd&#275;
(Oriya) M&#275;dara. Like the M&#275;daras, they work in split bamboo,
and make sundry articles which are not made by other castes who work in
this medium. Unlike the G&#363;dalas, they are a polluting class, and
have the following legend to account for their social degradation. God
told them to make winnows and other articles for divine worship. This,
they did, and, after they had delivered them, they attended a marriage
feast, at which they eat flesh and drank liquor. On their return, God
called on them to vomit the food which they had partaken of, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>they accordingly brought up the meat and drink,
whereon God cursed them, saying &ldquo;Begone, you have eaten forbidden
food.&rdquo; They craved for forgiveness, but were told in future to
earn their living as bamboo-workers. The custom of m&#275;narikam,
according to which a man should marry his maternal uncle&rsquo;s
daughter, is so rigidly enforced that, if the uncle refuses to give his
daughter in marriage, the man has a right to carry her off, and then
pay a fine, the amount of which is fixed by the caste council. A
portion thereof is given to the girl&rsquo;s parents, and the remainder
spent on a caste feast. If the maternal uncle has no daughter, a man
may, according to the &#275;duru (or reversed) m&#275;narikam custom,
marry his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. Six months before the
marriage ceremony takes place, the pasupu (turmeric) ceremony is
performed. The bridegroom&rsquo;s family pay six rupees to the
bride&rsquo;s family, to provide the girl with turmeric, wherewith she
adorns herself. On the day fixed for the wedding, the parents of the
bridegroom go with a few of the elders to the bride&rsquo;s house, and
couple the request to take away the girl with payment of nine rupees
and a new cloth. Of the money thus given, eight rupees go to the
bride&rsquo;s parents, and the remainder to the caste. The bride is
conducted to the home of the bridegroom, who meets her at the pandal
(booth) erected in front of his house. They are bathed with turmeric
water, and sacred threads are put on their shoulders by the Kula
Maistri who officiates as priest. The couple then play with seven cowry
(<i>Cypr&oelig;a arabica</i>) shells, and, if the shells fall with the
slit downwards, the bride is said to have won; otherwise the bridegroom
is the winner. This is followed by the m&#363;du &#257;kula h&#333;mam,
or sacrifice of three leaves. A new pot, containing a lighted wick, is
placed before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283"
name="pb283">283</a>]</span>couple. On it are thrown leaves of the
r&#257;yi &#257;ku (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), marri &#257;ku (<i>Ficus
Bengalensis</i>), and juvvi &#257;ku (<i>Ficus Tsiela</i>). The Kula
Maistri of the bridegroom&rsquo;s party spreads out his right hand over
the mouth of the pot. On it the bride places her hand. The bridegroom
then places his hand on hers, and the Kula Maistri of the bride&rsquo;s
village puts his hand on that of the bridegroom. The elders then call
out in a loud voice &ldquo;Know, caste people of Vadd&#257;di
M&#257;dugula; know, caste people of Kimedi; know, caste people of
Gunupuram and Godairi; know, caste people of all the twelve countries,
that this man and woman have become husband and wife, and that the
elders have ratified the ceremony.&rdquo; The contracting couple then
throw rice over each other. On the morning of the following day, the
saragatha ceremony is performed. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party repair to
the bank of the local stream, where they are met by the caste people,
who are presented with betel, a cheroot, and a pot of jaggery (crude
sugar) water as cool drink. The sacred threads worn by the bride and
bridegroom are removed at the conclusion of the marriage ceremonies.
The remarriage of widows is permitted, and a younger brother may marry
the widow of an elder brother, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Divorce is
also allowed, and a divorc&eacute;e may remarry. Her new husband has to
pay a sum of money, a portion of which goes to the first husband, while
the remainder is devoted to a caste feast. The dead are burnt, and the
chinna r&#333;zu (little day) death ceremony is observed.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;da-j&#257;ti</b> (wall people).&mdash;A sub-division of
Kammas. The name has reference to a deadly struggle at Gandik&#333;ta,
in which some escaped by hiding behind a wall.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;da-poose</b> (wall polishing).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Ts&#257;kala. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=

<p><b>G&#333;d&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as Telugu leather-workers in Ganjam and Vizagapatam. They
are stated, in the Vizagapatam Manual, to make and sell slippers in
that district. G&#333;d&#257;ri is, I gather, a synonym of M&#257;diga,
and not a separate caste.</p>
<p><b>Goddali</b> (spade or axe).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Odd&#275;

<p><b>G&#333;dom&#257;lia</b> (belonging to, or a group of

as barbers to R&#257;jahs who reside in forts.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;laka.</b>&mdash;Recorded in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as a name meaning bastard, and clubbed with the Moilis, or temple
servants in South Canara descended from dancing-girls. In the Mysore
Census Report, 1901, it is defined as a term applied to the children of
Br&#257;hmans by Malerus, or temple servants.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;li</b> (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>: a pot-herb).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of Gauda.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;lkonda.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Ts&#257;kala.</p>
<p><b>Golla.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The Gollas,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6799src" href="#xd21e6799" name=
"xd21e6799src">17</a> &ldquo;are the great pastoral caste of the Telugu
people. The traditions of the caste give a descent from the god
Krishna, whose sportings with the milk maids play a prominent part in
Hindu mythology. The hereditary occupation of the Gollas is tending
sheep and cattle, and selling milk, but many of them have now acquired
lands and are engaged in farming, and some are in Government service.
They are quiet, inoffensive, and comparatively honest. In the time of
the Nabobs, this last characteristic secured to them the privilege of
guarding and carrying treasure, and one sub-division, Bokhasa Gollas,
owes its origin to this service. Even <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>now those who are
employed in packing and lifting bags of money in the district
treasuries are called Gollas, though they belong to other castes. As a
fact they do hold a respectable position, and, though poor, are not
looked down upon, for they tend the sacred cow. Sometimes they assert a
claim to be regarded as representatives of the G&#333;-Vaisya division.
Their title is Mand&#257;di, but it is not commonly used.&rdquo; Mr.
Stuart writes further<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6804src" href=
"#xd21e6804" name="xd21e6804src">18</a> that &ldquo;the social status
of the Gollas is fairly high, for they are allowed to mix freely with
the K&#257;pu, Kamma, and Balija castes, and the Br&#257;hmans will
take buttermilk from their hands. They employ S&#257;t&#257;nis as
their priests. In their ceremonies there is not much difference between
them and the K&#257;pus. The name Golla is generally supposed to be a
shortened form of Sanskrit G&#333;p&#257;la&rdquo; (protector of cows).
The Gollas also call themselves K&#333;n&#257;nulu, or K&#333;narlu,
and, like the Tamil Idaiyans, sometimes have the title K&#333;nar.
Other titles in common use are Anna, Ayya, and occasionally Nayudu.</p>
<p>In the Manual of the Kurnool district, it is stated that the Gollas
&ldquo;keep sheep, and sell milk and gh&#299; (clarified butter). They
eat and mess with the Balijas, and other high caste S&#363;dras; but,
unlike their brethren of the south, in the matter of street
processions, they are classed with goldsmiths, or the left-hand
section. When any one is reduced to poverty, the others give him each a
sheep, and restore his flock. They occasionally dedicate their girls to
Venkat&#275;sa as Basavis&rdquo; (prostitutes).</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;in the country round M&#257;dgole, legends are still recounted
of a line of local Golla chieftains, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>gave their name to
Golgonda, and built the forts, of which traces still survive in those
parts&rdquo;. Each Telugu New Year&rsquo;s day, it is stated, Gollas
come across from God&#257;vari, and go round the Golla villages,
reciting the names of the progenitors of the fallen line, and
exhibiting paintings illustrative of their overthrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Vajragada (diamond fort) are the ruins of a very large
fortress, and local tradition gives the names of seven forts, by which
it was once defended. These are said to have been constructed by the
Golla kings. A tale is told of their having kidnapped a daughter of the
ruler of M&#257;dgole, and held out here against his attacks for
months, until they were betrayed by a woman of their own caste, who
showed the enemy how to cut off their water-supply. They then slew
their womenkind, says the story, dashed out against the besiegers, and
fell to a man, fighting to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Gollas of Mysore, I gather<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6817src" href="#xd21e6817" name="xd21e6817src">19</a> that
&ldquo;there are two main divisions in this caste, viz., &#362;ru
(village) and K&#257;du (forest). The two neither intermarry, nor eat
together. A section of the Gollas, by guarding treasure while on
transit, have earned the name of Dhanap&#257;la. In fact, one of the
menial offices in Government treasuries at the present day is that of
Golla. The caste worships Krishna, who was born in this caste. The
K&#257;du Gollas are said to have originally immigrated from Northern
India, and are still a nomadic tribe, living in thatched huts outside
the villages. Some of their social customs are akin to those of the
K&#257;du Kurubas. It is said that, on the occurrence of a childbirth,
the mother with the babe remains unattended in a small shed outside the
village from seven to thirty days, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287"
href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>when she is taken back to her
home. In the event of her illness, none of the caste will attend on
her, but a N&#257;yak (B&#275;da) woman is engaged to do so. Marriages
among them are likewise performed in a temporary shed erected outside
the village, and the attendant festivities continue for five days, when
the marriage couple are brought into the village. The Golla is allowed
to marry as many wives as he likes, and puberty is no bar to marriage.
They eat flesh, and drink spirituous liquors. The wife cannot be
divorced except for adultery. Their females do not wear the bodice
(ravik&#275;) usually put on by the women of the country. Nor do they,
in their widowhood, remove or break the glass bangles worn at the
wrists, as is done in other castes. But widows are not allowed to
remarry. Only 98 persons have returned g&#333;tras, the chief being
Y&#257;dava, Karadi, Atr&#275;ya, and Amswasa. The first two are really
sub-sects, while Atr&#275;ya is the name of a Br&#257;hmin
Rishi.&rdquo; Y&#257;dava, or descendant of King Y&#257;du, from whom
Krishna was descended, also occurs as a synonym for Idaiyan, the great
Tamil shepherd class.</p>

</div>
<p>Concerning the Adivi, or forest Gollas, Mr. F. Fawcett writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6830src" href="#xd21e6830" name=
"xd21e6830src">20</a> &ldquo;The people of every house in the village
let loose a sheep, to wander whither it will, as a sort of perpetual
scapegoat. When a woman feels the first pains of labour, she is turned
out of the village into a little leaf or mat hut about two hundred
yards away. In this hut she must bring forth her offspring unaided,
unless a midwife can be called in to be with her before the child is
born. For ninety days the woman lives in the hut by herself. If any one
touches her, he or she is, like the woman, outcasted, and turned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>out of the village for three months. The
woman&rsquo;s husband generally makes a little hut about fifty yards
from her, and watches over her; but he may not go near her on pain of
being outcasted for three months. Food is placed on the ground near the
woman&rsquo;s hut, and she takes it. On the fourth day after
parturition, a woman of the village goes to her, and pours water on
her, but she must not come in contact with her. On the fifth day, the
village people clear of stones and thorny bushes a little bit of ground
about ten yards on the village side of the hut, and to this place the
woman removes her hut. No one can do it for her, or help her. On the
ninth, fifteenth, and thirtieth days, she removes the hut in the same
way nearer to the village, and, again, once in each of the two
following months. On the ninetieth day, the headman of the village
calls the woman to come out of the hut. The dh&#333;bi (washerman) then
washes her clothes. She puts on clean clothes, and the headman takes
her to the temple of their tutelary deity Junjappa, where the caste
p&#363;jari breaks cocoanuts, and then accompanies her to her house,
where a purificatory ceremony is performed. Junjappa, it is said, takes
good care of the mother and child, so that death is said to be
unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is stated<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6837src" href="#xd21e6837"
name="xd21e6837src">21</a> that, in the Chitaldr&#363;g district of
Mysore, &ldquo;the wife of the eldest son in every family is not
permitted to clean herself with water after obeying the calls of
nature. It is an article of their belief that their flocks will
otherwise not prosper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing in the early part of the last century about the Gollas,
Buchanan informs us that &ldquo;this caste has a particular duty, the
transporting of money, both belonging <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>to the public and to
individuals. It is said that they may be safely intrusted with any sum;
for, each man carrying a certain value, they travel in bodies numerous
in proportion to the sum put under their charge; and they consider
themselves bound in honour to die in defence of their trust. Of course,
they defend themselves vigorously, and are all armed; so that robbers
never venture to attack them. They have hereditary chiefs called
Gotugaru, who with the usual council settle all disputes, and punish
all transgressions against the rules of caste. The most flagrant is the
embezzlement of money entrusted to their care. On this crime being
proved against any of the caste, the Gotugaru applies to Amildar, or
civil magistrate, and having obtained his leave, immediately causes the
delinquent to be shot. Smaller offences are atoned for by the guilty
person giving an entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golla caste has many sub-divisions, of which the following are
examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Erra or Yerra (red). Said to be the descendants of a
Br&#257;hman by a Golla woman.</p>
<p>&#256;la or M&#275;kala, who tend sheep and goats.</p>
<p>P&#363;ja or Puni.</p>
<p>Gangeddu, who exhibit performing bulls.</p>
<p>Gauda, who, in Vizagapatam, visit the western part of the district
during the summer months, and settle outside the villages. They tend
their herds, and sell milk and curds to the villagers.</p>
<p>Karna.</p>
<p>P&#257;kan&#257;ti.</p>
<p>R&#257;cha (royal).</p>
<p>Peddeti. Mostly beggars, and considered low in the social scale,
though when questioned concerning themselves they say they are Yerra
Gollas.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=

<p>At the census, 1901, the following were returned as sub-castes of
the Gollas:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dayy&#257;lakulam (wrestlers), Perike Muggalu or Mushti Golla
(beggars and exorcists), Podap&#333;tula (who beg from Gollas),
Gav&#257;di, and Vadug&#257;yan, a Tamil synonym for Gollas in
Tinnevelly. Another Tamil synonym for Golla is Bokhisha Vadugar
(treasury northerners). Golla has been given as a sub-division of
D&#257;saris and Chakkiliyans, and Golla Woddar (Odd&#275;) as a
synonym of a thief class in the Telugu country. In a village near
Dummagudem in the God&#257;vari district, the Rev. J. Cain
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6871src" href="#xd21e6871" name=
"xd21e6871src">22</a> are &ldquo;a few families of B&#257;sava Gollalu.
I find they are really Kois, whose grandfathers had a quarrel with, and
separated from, their neighbours. Some of the present members of the
families are anxious to be re-admitted to the society and privileges of
the neighbouring Kois. The word B&#257;sava is commonly said to be
derived from bh&#257;sha, a language, and the Gollas of this class are
said to have been so called in consequence of their speaking a
different language from the rest of the Gollas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many other Telugu castes, the Gollas have exogamous septs or
intip&#275;ru, and g&#333;tras. As examples of the former, the
following may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those who belong to the R&#257;ghindala (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>)
g&#333;tra are not allowed to use the leaves of the sacred fig or
p&#299;pal tree as plates for their food. Members of the
P&#257;l&#257;vili g&#333;tra never construct p&#257;l&#257;vili, or
small booths, inside the house for the purpose of worship. Those who
belong to the Akshathayya g&#333;tra are said to avoid rice coloured
with turmeric or other powder (akshantalu). Members of the Kommi,
Jammi, and M&#363;shti g&#333;tras avoid using the kommi tree,
<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>, and <i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>
respectively.</p>
<p>Of the various sub-divisions, the P&#363;ja Gollas claim superiority
over the others. Their origin is traced to Simh&#257;dri R&#257;ju, who
is supposed to have been a descendant of Yay&#257;thi R&#257;ja of the
Mah&#257;baratha. Yay&#257;thi had six sons, the last of whom had a son
named Kariy&#257;vala, whose descendants were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6949width"><img src="images/fig2-291.png" alt=
"Diagram of descendants of Kariy&#257;vala." width="464" height=

<p>The Gollas are believed to be descended from the four last kings.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to another legend, there were five brothers, named
P&#333;li R&#257;ju, Erranoku R&#257;ju, K&#257;tama R&#257;ju, Peddi
R&#257;ju, and Errayya R&#257;ju, who lived at Yellamanchili, which, as
well as Sarvasiddhi, they built. The R&#257;jas of Nellore advanced
against them, and killed them, with all their sheep, in battle. On
this, Janagamayya, the son of Peddi R&#257;ju, who escaped the general
slaughter, made up his mind to go to K&#257;si (Benares), and offer
oblations to his dead father and uncles. This he did, and the gods were
so pleased with him that they transported him in the air to his native
place. He was followed by three persons, viz., (1) Kulagentadu, whose
descendants now recite the names of the progenitors of the caste; (2)
Podap&#333;ttu (or juggler), whose descendants carry metal bells, sing,
and produce snakes by magic; (3) Th&#275;vas&#299;yadu, whose
descendants paint the events which led to the destruction of the Golla
royalty on large cloths, and exhibit them to the Gollas once a year. At
the time when Janagamayya was translated to heaven, they asked him how
they were to earn their living, and he advised them to perform the
duties indicated, and beg from the caste. Even at the present day,
their descendants go round the country once a year, after the Telugu
New Year&rsquo;s day, and collect their dues from Golla villages.</p>
<p>By religion the Gollas are both Vallamulu (Vaishnavites) and
Striramanthulu (Saivites), between whom marriage is permissible. They
belong to the group of castes who take part in the worship of Ankamma.
A special feature of their worship is that they place in a bamboo or
rattan box three or four long whip-like ropes made of cotton or
<i>Agave</i> fibre, along with swords, sandals and idols. The ropes are
called V&#299;rath&#257;dlu, or heroes&rsquo; ropes. The contents of
the box are set beneath <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>a booth made of split bamboo
(p&#257;l&#257;vili), and decorated with mango leaves, and flowers.
There also is placed a pot containing several smaller pots, cowry
shells, metal and earthenware sandals, and the image of a bull called
bolli-&#257;vu (bull idol). When not required for the purpose of
worship, the idols are hung up in a room, which may not be entered by
any one under pollution.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Golla Ganga muggu.</p>
</div>
<p>Some Karna Gollas earn their living by selling poultry, or by going
about the country carrying on their head a small box containing idols
and V&#299;rath&#257;dlu. Placing this at the end of a street, they do
puja (worship) before it, and walk up and down with a rope, with which
they flagellate themselves. As they carry the gods (D&#275;varlu)
about, these people are called D&#275;vara vallu.</p>
<p>As the Gollas belong to the left-hand section, the Pedda Golla, or
headman, has only a M&#257;diga as his assistant.</p>
<p>At the marriages of Mutr&#257;chas, M&#257;digas, and some other
classes, a form of worship called V&#299;rala p&#363;ja is performed
with the object of propitiating heroes or ancestors (v&#299;ralu). A
kindred ceremony, called Ganga p&#363;ja, is carried out by the Gollas,
the expenses of which amount to about a hundred rupees. This Ganga
worship lasts over three days, during which nine patterns, called
muggu, are drawn on the floor in five colours, and represent
dh&#257;marapadmam (lotus flower), p&#257;l&#257;vili (booth),
sul&#257;lu (tridents), sesha panpu (serpent&rsquo;s play?), alugula
simh&#257;sanam (throne of Sakti), V&#299;radu p&#275;rant&#257;lu
(hero and his wife), R&#257;nivasam (R&#257;ni&rsquo;s palace),
b&#333;nala (food), and Ganga. The last is a female figure, and
probably represents Ganga, the goddess of water, though one of the
Golla ancestors was named Gangi R&#257;ju. The patterns must be drawn
by M&#257;digas or M&#257;las. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>Three Pambalas, or
M&#257;digas skilled in this work, and in reciting the stories of
various gods and goddesses, commence their work on the afternoon of the
third day, and use white powder (rice flour), and powders coloured
yellow (turmeric), red (turmeric and chunam), green (leaves of
<i>Cassia auriculata</i>), and black (charred rice husk). On an
occasion when my assistant was present, the designs were drawn on the
floor of the courtyard of the house, which was roofed over. During the
preparation of the designs, people were excluded from the yard, as some
ill-luck, especially an attack of fever, would befall more particularly
boys and those of feeble mind, if they caught sight of the muggu before
the drishti th&#299;yadam, or ceremony for removing the evil eye has
been performed. Near the head of the figure of Ganga, when completed,
was placed an old bamboo box, regarded as a god, containing idols,
ropes, betel, flowers, and small swords. Close to the box, and on the
right side of the figure, an earthen tray, containing a lighted wick
fed with gh&#299; (clarified butter) was set. On the left side were
deposited a kalasam (brass vessel) representing Siva, a row of chembus
(vessels) called b&#333;nalu (food vessels), and a small empty box tied
up in a cloth dyed with turmeric, and called Brammayya. Between these
articles and the figure, a sword was laid. Several heaps of food were
piled up on the figure, and masses of rice placed near the head and
feet. In addition, a conical mass of food was heaped up on the right
side of the figure, and cakes were stuck into it. All round this were
placed smaller conical piles of food, into which broomsticks decorated
with betel leaves were thrust. Masses of food, scooped out and
converted into lamps, were arranged in various places, and betel leaves
and nuts scattered all over the figure. Towards the feet <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>were
set a chembu filled with water, a lump of food coloured red, and
incense. The preparations concluded, three Gollas stood near the feet
of the figure, and took hold of the red food, over which water had been
sprinkled, the incense and a fowl. The food and incense were then waved
in front of the figure, and the fowl, after it had been smoked by the
incense, and waved over the figure, had its neck wrung. This was
followed by the breaking of a cocoanut, and offering fruits and other
things. The three men then fell prostrate on the ground before the
figure, and saluted the goddess. One of them, an old man, tied little
bells round his legs, and stood mute for a time. Gradually he began to
perspire, and those present exclaimed that he was about to be possessed
by the spirit of an ancestor. Taking up a sword, he began to cut
himself with it, especially in the back, and then kept striking himself
with the blunt edge. The sword was wrested from him, and placed on the
figure. The old man then went several times round the muggu, shaking
and twisting his body into various grotesque attitudes. While this was
going on, the bridegroom appeared on the scene, and seated himself near
the feet of the figure. Throwing off his turban and upper cloth, he
fell on the floor, and proceeded to kick his legs about, and
eventually, becoming calmer, commenced to cry. Being asked his name, he
replied that he was Kariyavala R&#257;ju. Further questions were put to
him, to which he made no response, but continued crying. Incense and
lights were then carried round the image, and the old man announced
that the marriage would be auspicious, and blessed the bride and
bridegroom and the assembled Gollas. The ceremony concluded with the
burning of camphor. The big mass of food was eaten by P&#363;ni Gollas.

<p>It is stated in the Manual of the Nellore district that, when a
Golla bridegroom sets out for the house of his mother-in-law, he is
seized on the way by his companions, who will not release him until he
has paid a piece of gold.</p>
<p>The custom of illatom, or application of a son-in-law, obtains among
the Gollas, as among the K&#257;pus and some other
Telugu-classes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6988src" href="#xd21e6988"

<p>In connection with the death ceremonies, it may be noted that the
corpse, when it is being washed, is made to rest on a mortar, and two
pestles are placed by its side, and a lighted lamp near the head.</p>
<p>There is a proverb to the effect that a Golla will not scruple to
water the milk which he sells to his own father. Another proverb refers
to the corrupt manner in which he speaks his mother-tongue.</p>

origin like the B&#363;dabudikes, and may perhaps be a sub-division of
them. They are worshippers of Durgi. Their occupation, as the name
indicates, is to perform gondala, or a kind of torch-light dance,
usually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=

<p><b>G&#333;n&#275;</b> (a sack).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
M&#257;ala. The G&#333;n&#275; Perikes have been summed up as being a
Telugu caste of gunny-bag weavers, corresponding to the Janappans of
the Tamil country. Gunny-bag is the popular and trading name for the
coarse sacking and sacks made from jute fibre, which are extensively
used in Indian trade.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7030src" href=
"#xd21e7030" name="xd21e7030src">25</a> G&#333;n&#275; is further an

<p>The G&#333;nigas of Mysore are described, in the Census Report,

grain porters at Bangalore; and it is noted that the abnormal fall of
66 per cent. in the number of the caste was due to their being
confounded with G&#257;nigas.</p>

<p><b>G&#333;r&#275;.</b>&mdash;Recorded, at times of census, as a

trading Lamb&#257;dis may have assumed the name.</p>
<p><b>Gorige</b> (<i>Cyamopsis psoralioides</i>).&mdash;An exogamous
sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Gorrela</b> (sheep).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Golla, Kamma, and
K&#257;pu. Konda gorri (hill sheep) occurs as an exogamous sept of
J&#257;tapu.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;sangi.</b>&mdash;A synonym for M&#257;diga, recorded as
K&#333;sangi, in the Madras Census Report, 1901. The G&#333;sangulu are
described in the Vizagapatam Manual (1869), as &ldquo;beggars who style
themselves descendants of J&#257;mbavanta, the bear into which Brahma
transformed himself, to assist R&#257;ma in destroying R&#257;vana. The
G&#333;sangis are considered to be illegitimate descendants of
M&#257;digas, and a curious thing about them is that their women dress
up like men, and sing songs when begging. As mendicants they are
attached to the M&#257;digas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>G&#333;s&#257;yi or G&#333;sw&#257;mi.</b>&mdash;The
G&#333;s&#257;yis are immigrant religious mendicants from Northern and
Western India. I gather from the Mysore Census Reports that &ldquo;they
mostly belong to the Dandi sub-division. The G&#333;s&#257;yi is no
caste; commonly any devotee is called a G&#333;s&#257;yi, whether he
lives a life of celibacy or not; whether he roams about the country
collecting alms, or resides in a house like the rest of the people;
whether he leads an idle existence, or employs himself in trade. The
mark, however, that distinguishes all who bear this name is that they
are devoted to a religious life. Some besmear their bodies with ashes,
wear their hair dishevelled and uncombed, and in some instances coiled
round the head like a snake or rope. They roam about the country in
every direction, visiting especially spots <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>of
reputed sanctity, and as a class are the pests of society and
incorrigible rogues. Some of them can read, and a few may be learned;
but for the most part they are stolidly ignorant. Most of them wear a
yellowish cloth, by which they make themselves conspicuous. The
G&#333;s&#257;yis, although by profession belonging to the religious
class, apply themselves nevertheless to commerce and trade. As
merchants, bankers and tradesmen, they hold a very respectable
position. They never marry. One of the chief peculiarities of this
caste is that Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriy&#257;s, Vaisy&#257;s, and
S&#363;dras, the two former especially, may, if they choose, become
G&#333;s&#257;yis; but if they do so, and unite with the members of
this fraternity in eating and drinking, holding full and free
intercourse with them, they are cut off for ever from their own tribes.
It is this circumstance which constitutes G&#333;s&#257;yis a distinct
and legitimate caste, and not merely a religious order. At death a
horrible custom is observed. A cocoanut is broken on the head of the
deceased by a person specially appointed for the purpose, until it is
smashed to pieces. The body is then wrapped in a reddish cloth, and
thrown into the Ganges. A partial explanation of this practice is
furnished in Southern India. The final aim of Hindu religious life is
Nirv&#257;na or M&#333;ksham in the next life, and this can only be
attained by those holy men, whose life escapes, after smashing the
skull, through the sushumn&#257; n&#257;di, a nerve so called, and
supposed to pervade the crown of the head. The dying or dead
Sany&#257;si is considered to have led such a holy life as to have
expired in the orthodox manner, and the fiction is kept up by breaking
the skull <i>post mortem</i>, in mimicry of the guarantee of his
passage to eternal bliss. Accordingly, the dead body of a Br&#257;hman
Sany&#257;si in Southern India undergoes the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>same
process and is buried, but never burned or thrown into the
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few G&#333;s&#257;yis, at the Mysore census, returned g&#333;tras,
of which the chief were Ach&#363;ta and Daridra (poverty-stricken). In
the Madras Census Report, 1901, Mandula (medicine man) and
B&#257;v&#257;ji are returned as a sub-division and synonym of
G&#333;s&#257;yi. The name G&#363;s&#275; or Gusei is applied to Oriya
Br&#257;hmans owing to their right of acting as gurus or family
priests.</p>
<p><b>G&#333;su</b> (pride).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Goundan.</b>&mdash;It is noted, in the Salem Manual, that
&ldquo;some of the agricultural classes habitually append the title
Goundan as a sort of caste nomenclature after their names, but the word
applies, par excellence, to the head of the village, or &#362;r Goundan
as he is called.&rdquo; As examples of castes which take Goundan as
their title, the Pallis, Okkiliyans, and Vell&#257;las may be cited. A
planter, or other, when hailing a Malay&#257;li of the Shevaroy hills,
always calls him Goundan.</p>
<p><b>Goyi</b> (lizard: <i>Varanus</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Bottada.</p>
<p><b>Gr&#257;mani.</b>&mdash;The title of some Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, and
of the headman of the Khatris. In Malabar, the name gr&#257;mam (a
village) is applied to a Br&#257;hmanical colony, or collection of
houses, as the equivalent of the agrah&#257;ram of the Tamil
country.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7127src" href="#xd21e7127" name=
"xd21e7127src">26</a></p>
<p><b>G&#363;dala.</b>&mdash;The G&#363;dalas are a Telugu caste of
basket-makers in Vizagapatam and Ganjam. The name is derived from
g&#363;da, a basket for baling water. For the following note I am
indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The original occupation of the caste
is said to have been the collection of medicinal herbs and roots for
native <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>doctors and sick persons, which is still carried
on by some G&#363;dalas at S&#257;l&#363;ru town. The principal
occupations, however, are the manufacture of bamboo baskets, and
fishing in fresh water.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the G&#363;dalas have exogamous septs or
intip&#275;rulu, <i>e.g.</i>, korra (<i>Setaria italica</i>), paththi
(cotton), nakka (jackal) and ganti (hole pierced in the ear-lobe). The
custom of m&#275;narikam, whereby a man should marry his maternal
uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is practiced. Marriage generally takes place
before a girl reaches puberty. A Br&#257;hman officiates at weddings.
The bride-price (v&#333;li) consists of a new cloth for the bride, and
seven rupees for her parents, which are taken by the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party to the bride&rsquo;s house, together with some oil and turmeric
for the bridal bath, and the satham&#257;nam (marriage badge). A feast
is held, and the satham&#257;nam is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck. The
newly married pair are conducted to the house of the bridegroom, where
a further feast takes place, after which they return to the
bride&rsquo;s home, where they remain for three days. Widows are
permitted to remarry thrice, and the v&#333;li on each successive
occasion is Rs. 3, Rs. 2, and Rs. 2&ndash;8&ndash;0. When a widow is
remarried, the satham&#257;nam is tied on her neck near a mortar.</p>
<p>The members of the caste reverence a deity called Ekkalad&#275;vata,
who is said to have been left behind at their original home. The dead
are cremated, and the chinna r&#333;zu (little day) death ceremony is
observed. On the third day, cooked rice is thrown over the spot where
the corpse was burnt.</p>
<p><b>G&#363;davandlu.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Nellore Manual, as
Vaishnavites, who earn their livelihood by begging. The name means
basket people, and probably refers to S&#257;t&#257;nis, who carry a
basket (g&#363;da) when begging. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302"
href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Gudi</b> (temple).&mdash;A sub-division of Okkiliyan, an
exogamous sept of J&#333;gi, and a name for temple D&#257;saris, to
distinguish them from the Donga or thieving D&#257;saris.</p>
<p><b>Gudig&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;In the South Canara Manual, the
Gudig&#257;ras are summed up as follows. &ldquo;They are a Canarese
caste of wood-carvers and painters. They are Hindus of the Saivite
sect, and wear the sacred thread. Shivalli Br&#257;hmans officiate as
their priests. Some follow the aliya sant&#257;na mode of inheritance
(in the female line), others the ordinary law. They must marry within
the caste, but not within the same g&#333;tra or family. Infant
marriage is not compulsory, and they have the dh&#257;re form of
marriage. Among those who follow the aliya sant&#257;na law, both
widows and divorced women may marry again, but this is not permitted
among the other sections. The dead are either cremated or buried, the
former being the preferential mode. The use of alcoholic liquor, and
fish and flesh is permitted. Their ordinary title is Setti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gudigars, or sandal-wood carvers,&rdquo; Mr. D&rsquo;Cruz
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7162src" href="#xd21e7162" name=
"xd21e7162src">27</a> &ldquo;are reported to have come originally from
Goa, their migration to Mysore and Canara having been occasioned by the
attempts of the early Portuguese invaders to convert them to
Christianity. The fact that their original language is Konkani
corroborates their reputed Konkanese origin. They say that the
derivation of the word Gudig&#257;ra is from gudi, a temple, and that
they were so called because they were, in their own country, employed
as carvers and painters in the ornamentation of temples. Another
derivation is from the Sanskrit kuttaka (a carver). They assert that
their fellow castemen are still employed in turning, painting, and
other decorative arts at Goa. Like the Chitrak&#257;ras <span class=

to be Kshatriyas, and tradition has it that, to escape the wrath of
Parasu R&#257;ma in the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, who vowed to
destroy all Kshatriyas, they adopted the profession of carvers and
car-builders. They are also expert ivory-carvers, and it has been
suggested that they may be distantly connected with the Kondikars, or
ivory-carvers of Bengal. The art of sandalwood carving is confined to a
few families in the Sorab and S&#257;gar t&#257;luks of the Shimoga
district, in the north-west corner of the province. There are two or
three families in S&#257;gar, and about six in Sorab, which contribute
in all about thirty-five artisans employed in the craft. The art is
also practiced by their relations, who found a domicile in Hanavar,
Kumpta, Sirsi, Siddap&#363;r, Biligi, and Banav&#257;si in the North
Canara district. But the work of the latter is said to be by no means
so fine as that executed by the artisans of Sorab and S&#257;gar. The
artisans of North Canara, however, excel in pith-work of the most
exquisite beauty. They usually make b&#257;singas, <i>i.e.</i>, special
forehead ornaments, richly inlaid with pearls, and worn on the occasion
of marriage. The delicate tools used by the wood-carvers are made from
European umbrella spokes, ramrods, and country steel. The main
stimulus, which the art receives from time to time at the present day,
is from orders from the Government, corporate public bodies, or
Mah&#257;r&#257;jas, for address boxes, cabinets, and other articles
specially ordered for presentations, or for the various fine-art
exhibition, for which high prices are paid.&rdquo; In conversation with
the workmen from Sorab and S&#257;gar for work in the palace which is
being built for H. H. the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Mysore, it was elicited
that there are some Gudigars, who, from want of a due taste for the
art, never acquire it, but are engaged in carpentry and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>turning. Others, having acquired land, are
engaged in cultivation, and fast losing all touch with the art. At
Udipi in South Canara, some Gudigars make for sale large wooden
buffaloes and human figures, which are presented as votive offerings at
the Iswara temple at Hiriadk&#257;p. They also make wooden dolls and
painted clay figures.</p>
<p>The following extracts from Mr. L. Rice&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mysore
Gazetteer&rsquo; may be appropriately quoted. &ldquo;The designs with
which the Gudigars entirely cover the boxes, desks, and other articles
made, are of an extremely involved and elaborate pattern, consisting
for the most part of intricate interlacing foliage and scroll-work,
completely enveloping medallions containing the representation of some
Hindu deity or subject of mythology, and here and there relieved by the
introduction of animal forms. The details, though in themselves often
highly incongruous, are grouped and blended with a skill that seems to
be instinctive in the East, and form an exceedingly rich and
appropriate ornamentation, decidedly oriental in style, which leaves
not the smallest portion of the surface of the wood untouched. The
material is hard, and the minuteness of the work demands the utmost
care and patience. Hence the carving of a desk or cabinet involves a
labour of many months, and the artists are said to lose <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e7174" title="Source: there">their</span> eyesight at a
comparatively early age. European designs they imitate to
perfection.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;The articles of the
Gudigar&rsquo;s manufacture chiefly in demand are boxes, caskets and
cabinets. These are completely covered with minute and delicate
scroll-work, interspersed with figures from the Hindu Pantheon, the
general effect of the profuse detail being extremely rich. The carving
of Sorab is considered superior to that of Bombay or Canton, and, being
a very tedious process requiring great care, is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>expensive. The Gudigars will imitate admirably
any designs that may be furnished them. Boards for album-covers, plates
from Jorrock&rsquo;s hunt, and cabinets surrounded with figures, have
thus been produced for European gentlemen with great success.&rdquo; A
gold medal was awarded to the Gudigars at the Delhi Durbar Exhibition,
1903, for a magnificent sandal-wood casket (now in the Madras Museum),
ornamented with panels representing hunting scenes.</p>
<p>When a marriage is contemplated, the parents of the couple, in the
absence of horoscopes, go to a temple, and receive from the priest some
flowers which have been used for worship. These are counted, and, if
their number is even, the match is arranged, and an exchange of betel
leaves and nuts takes place. On the wedding day, the bridegroom goes,
accompanied by his party, to the house of the bride, taking with him a
new cloth, a female jacket, and a string of black beads with a small
gold ornament. They are met <i>en route</i> by the bride&rsquo;s party.
Each party has a tray containing rice, a cocoanut, and a looking-glass.
The females of one party place kunkuma (red powder) on the foreheads of
those of the other party, and sprinkle rice over each other. At the
entrance to the marriage pandal (booth), the bride&rsquo;s brother
pours water at the feet of the bridegroom, and her father leads him
into the pandal. The new cloth, and other articles, are taken inside
the house, and the mother or sister of the bridegroom, with the
permission of the headman, ties the necklet of black beads on the
bride&rsquo;s neck. Her maternal uncle takes her up in his arms, and
carries her to the pandal. Thither the bridegroom is conducted by the
bride&rsquo;s brother. A cloth is held as a screen between the
contracting couple, who place garlands of flowers round each
other&rsquo;s necks. The screen is then removed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>A
small vessel, containing milk and water, and decorated with mango
leaves, is placed in front of them, and the bride&rsquo;s mother,
taking hold of the right hand of the bride, places it in the right hand
of the bridegroom. The officiating Br&#257;hman places a betel leaf and
cocoanut on the bride&rsquo;s hand, and her parents pour water from a
vessel thereon. The Br&#257;hman then ties the kankanams
(wrist-threads) on the wrists of the contracting couple, and kindles
the sacred fire (h&#333;mam). The guests present them with money, and
lights are waved before them by elderly females. The bridegroom, taking
the bride by hand, leads her into the house, where they sit on a mat,
and drink milk out of the same vessel. A bed is made ready, and they
sit on it, while the bride gives betel to the bridegroom. On the second
day, lights are waved, in the morning and evening, in front of them. On
the third day, some red-coloured water is placed in a vessel, into
which a ring, an areca nut, and rice are dropped. The couple search for
the ring, and, when it has been found, the bridegroom puts it on the
finger of the bride. They then bathe, and try to catch fish in a cloth.
After the bath, the wrist-threads are removed.</p>
<p><b>Gudisa</b> (hut).&mdash;An exogamous sept of B&#333;ya and
K&#257;pu.</p>
<p><b>Gudiya.</b>&mdash;The Gudiyas are the sweet-meat sellers of the
Oriya country. They rank high in the social scale, and some sections of
Oriya Br&#257;hmans will accept drinking water at their hands.
Sweet-meats prepared by them are purchased for marriage feasts by all
castes, including Br&#257;hmans. The caste name is derived from gudo
(jaggery). The caste is divided into two sections, one of which is
engaged in selling sweet-meats and crude sugar, and the other in
agriculture. The former are called Gudiyas, and the latter Kol&#257;ta,
Holodia, or Bol&#257;si <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>Gudiyas in different localities.
The headman of the caste is called S&#257;sumallo, under whom are
assistant officers, called B&#275;hara and Bhollobaya. In their
ceremonial observances on the occasion of marriage, death, etc., the
Gudiyas closely follow the Gaudos. They profess the Paramartho or
Chaitanya form of Vaishnavism, and also worship T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities).</p>
<p>The Gudiyas are as particular as Br&#257;hmans in connection with
the wearing of sect marks, and ceremonial ablution. Cloths worn during
the act of attending to the calls of nature are considered to be
polluted, so they carry about with them a special cloth, which is
donned for the moment, and then removed. Like the Gudiyas, Oriya
Br&#257;hmans always carry with them a small cloth for this
purpose.</p>
<p>The titles of the Gudiyas are B&#275;hara, S&#257;hu, and
S&#257;sumallo. In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the caste name is
given as Godiya.</p>
<p><b>Gudugudup&#257;ndi.</b>&mdash;A Tamil synonym for
B&#363;dubudukala.</p>
<p><b>Guha Vell&#257;la.</b>&mdash;The name assumed by some Sembadavans
with a view to connecting themselves with Guha (or Kuha), who rowed the
boat of R&#257;ma to Ceylon, and, as Vell&#257;las, gaining a rise in
the social scale. Maravans also claim descent from Guha.</p>
<p><b>Gujar&#257;ti.</b>&mdash;A territorial name, meaning people from
Gujar&#257;t, some of whom have settled in the south where they carry
on business as prosperous traders. In the Madras Census Report, 1901,
Gujjar is returned as a synonym. At a public meeting held in Madras, in
1906, to concert measures for establishing a pinjrapole (hospital for
animals) it was resolved that early steps should be taken to collect
public subscriptions from the Hindu community generally, and in
particular from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span>N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis,
Gujar&#257;tis, and other mercantile classes. The mover of the
resolution observed that Gujar&#257;tis were most anxious, on religious
grounds, to save all animals from pain, and it was a religious belief
with them that it was sinful to live in a town where there was no
pinjrapole. A pinjrapole is properly a cage (pinjra) for the sacred
bull (pola) released in the name of Siva.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7214src" href="#xd21e7214" name="xd21e7214src">28</a> It is noted
by Mr. Drummond<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7217src" href="#xd21e7217"
name="xd21e7217src">29</a> that every marriage and mercantile
transaction among the Gujar&#257;tis is taxed with a contribution
ostensibly for the pinjrapole. In 1901, a proposal was set on foot to
establish a Gujar&#257;ti library and reading-room in Madras, to
commemorate the silver jubilee of the administration of the Gaekwar of
Baroda.</p>

g&#333;tra or exogamous sept of Kurni and Vakkaliga.</p>
<p><b>Gurukkal.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the Gurukkals or
Kurukkals of Travancore, I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The
Kurukkals are priests of castes, whose religious rites are not presided
over by Ilayatus. They are probably of Tamil origin. Males are often
called Nainar and females Nachchiyar, which are the usual titles of the
Tamil Kurukkals also. In the K&#275;ralolpatti the caste men are
described as Chilampantis, who are the adiyars or hereditary servants
of Padman&#257;bhasw&#257;mi in Trivandrum. They seem to have been once
known also as Madam&#363;talis or headmen of matts, and
T&#275;v&#257;ra Pand&#257;rams, or Pand&#257;rams who assisted the
Br&#257;hman priest in the performance of religious rites in the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s palace. It is said that the Kurukkals
originally belonged to the great Vaisya branch of Manu&rsquo;s fourfold
system of caste, and migrated from the P&#257;ndyan <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>country, and became the dependants of the
Kupakkara family of Pottis in Trivandrum, whose influence, both
religious and secular, was of no mean order in medi&aelig;val times.
These Pottis gave them permission to perform all the priestly services
of the Ambalav&#257;si families, who lived to the south of Quilon. It
would appear from the K&#275;ralolpatti and other records that they had
the kazhakam or sweeping and other services at the inner entrance of
Sr&#299; Padman&#257;bha&rsquo;s temple till the time of Umayamma
R&#257;ni in the eighth century of the Malabar era. As, however, during
her reign, a Kurukkal in league with the Kupakkara Potti handed over
the letter of invitation, entrusted to him as messenger, for the annual
utsavam to the Tarnallur Namb&#363;dirip&#257;d, the chief
ecclesiastical functionary of the temple, much later than was required,
the Kurukkal was dismissed from the temple service, and ever afterwards
the Kurukkals had no kazhakam right there. There are some temples,
where Kurukkals are the recognised priests, and they are freely
admitted for kazhakam service in most South Travancore temples. To the
north of Quilon, however, the V&#257;riyars and Pushpakans enjoy this
right in preference to others. Some Kurukkals kept gymnasia in former
times, and trained young men in military exercises. At the present day,
a few are agriculturists.</p>
<p>The Kurukkals are generally not so fair in complexion as other
sections of the Ambalav&#257;sis. Their houses are known as bhavanams
or vidus. They are strict vegetarians, and prohibited from drinking
spirituous liquor. The females (Kurukkattis) try to imitate
Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans in their dress and ornaments. The
arasilatt&#257;li, which closely resembles the cherut&#257;li, is worn
round the neck, and the chuttu in the ears. The mukkutti, but not the
gnattu, is worn in the nose. The minnu or marriage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>ornament is worn after the t&#257;li-kettu until
the death of the t&#257;li-tier. The females are tattooed on the
forehead and hands, but this practice is going out of fashion. The sect
marks of women are the same as those of the Namb&#363;tiris. The
Kurukkals are Smartas. The Tiruvonam asterism in the month of Avani
(August-September) furnishes an important festive occasion.</p>
<p>The Kurukkals are under the spiritual control of certain men in
their own caste called V&#257;dhyars. They are believed to have been
originally appointed by the Kuppakkara Pottis, of whom they still take
counsel.</p>
<p>The Kurukkals observe both the t&#257;li-kettu kaly&#257;nam and
sambandham. The male members of the caste contract alliances either
within the caste, or with M&#257;r&#257;ns, or the V&#257;tti class of
N&#257;yars. Women receive cloths either from Br&#257;hmans or men of
their own caste. The maternal uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s
daughter is regarded as the most proper wife for a man. The
t&#257;li-kettu ceremony is celebrated when a girl is seven, nine or
eleven years old. The date for its celebration is fixed by her father
and maternal uncle in consultation with the astrologer. As many youths
are then selected from among the families of the inangans or relations
as there are girls to be married, the choice being decided by the
agreement of the horoscopes of the couple. The erection of the first
pillar of the marriage pandal (booth) is, as among other Hindu castes,
an occasion for festivity. The ceremony generally lasts over few days,
but may be curtailed. On the wedding day, the bridegroom wears a sword
and palmyra leaf, and goes in procession to the house of the bride.
After the t&#257;li has been tied, the couple are looked on as being
impure, and the pollution is removed by bathing, and the pouring of
water, consecrated by the hymns of V&#257;dhyars, over their heads. For
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>sambandham, which invariably takes place after a
girl has reached puberty, the relations of the future husband visit her
home, and, if they are satisfied as to the desirability of the match,
inform her guardians of the date on which they will demand the
horoscope. When it is received on the appointed day, the astrologer is
consulted, and, if he is favourably inclined, a day is fixed for the
sambandham ceremony. The girl is led forward by her maternal aunt, who
sits among those who have assembled, and formally receives cloths.
Cloths are also presented to the maternal uncle. Divorce is common, and
effected with the consent of the V&#257;dhyar. Inheritance is in the
female line (marumakkath&#257;yam). It is believed that, at the time of
their migration to Travancore, the Kurukkals wore their tuft of hair
(kudumi) behind, and followed the makkath&#257;yam system of
inheritance (in the male line). A change is said to have been effected
in both these customs by the Kupakkara Potti in the years 1752 and 1777
of the Malabar era.</p>
<p>The Kurukkals observe most of the religious ceremonies of the
Br&#257;hmans. No recitation of hymns accompanies the rites of
n&#257;makarana and annapr&#257;sana. The chaula and upan&#257;yana are
performed between the ninth and twelfth years of age. On the previous
day, the family priest celebrates the purificatory rite, and ties a
consecrated thread round the right wrist of the boy. The tonsure takes
place on the second day, and on the third day the boy is invested with
the sacred thread, and the G&#257;yatri hymn recited. On the fourth
day, the Brahmach&#257;rya rite is closed with a ceremony corresponding
to the Sam&#257;vartana. When a girl reaches puberty, some near female
relation invites the women of the village, who visit the house,
bringing sweetmeats with them. The girl bathes, and reappears in public
on the fifth day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313"
name="pb313">313</a>]</span>Only the pulikudi or drinking tamarind
juice, is celebrated, as among the N&#257;yars, during the first
pregnancy. The sanchayana, or collection of bones after the cremation
of a corpse, is observed on the third, fifth, or seventh day after
death. Death pollution lasts for eleven days. Tekketus are built in
memory of deceased ancestors. These are small masonry structures built
over graves, in which a lighted lamp is placed, and at which worship is
performed on anniversary and other important occasions (<i>See</i>
Br&#257;hman.)</p>

<p class="first"><b>Haddi.</b>&mdash;The Haddis are a low class of
Oriyas, corresponding to the Telugu M&#257;las and M&#257;digas, and
the Tamil Paraiyans. It has been suggested that the name is derived
from haddi, a latrine, or hada, bones, as members of the caste collect
all sorts of bones, and trade in them. The Haddis play on drums for all
Oriya castes, except Khondras, Tiyoros, Tul&#257;binas, and S&#257;nis.
They consider the Khondras as a very low class, and will not purchase
boiled rice sold in the bazaar, if it has been touched by them. Castes
lower than the Haddis are the Khondras and Jaggalis of whom the latter
are Telugu M&#257;digas, who have settled in the southern part of
Ganjam, and learnt the Oriya language.</p>
<p>The Haddis may be divided into Haddis proper, Rellis, and Chachadis,
which are endogamous divisions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>The Haddis proper never do
sweeping or scavenging work, which are, in some places, done by Rellis.
The Relli scavengers are often called Bhatta or Karuva Haddis. The
Haddis proper go by various names, <i>e.g.</i>, Sudha Haddi,
G&#333;dom&#257;lia Haddi, etc., in different localities. The Haddis
work as coolies and field labourers, and the selling of fruits, such as
mango, tamarind, <i>Zizyphus Jujuba</i>, etc., is a favourite
occupation. In some places, the selling of dried fish is a monopoly of
the Rellis. Sometimes Haddis, especially the Karuva Haddis, sell human
or yak hair for the purpose of female toilette. The Haddis have
numerous septs or bamsams, one of which, hathi (elephant) is of special
interest, because members of this sept, when they see the foot-prints
of an elephant, take some dust from the spot, and make a mark on the
forehead with it. They also draw the figure of an elephant, and worship
it when they perform sr&#257;dh (memorial service for the dead) and
other ceremonies.</p>
<p>There are, among the Haddi communities, two caste officers entitled
B&#275;hara and N&#257;yako, and difficult questions which arise are
settled at a meeting of the officers of several villages. It is said
that sometimes, if a member of the caste is known to have committed an
offence, the officers select some members of the caste from his village
to attend the meeting, and borrow money from them. This is spent on
drink, and, after the meeting, the amount is recovered from the
offender. If he does not plead guilty at once, a quarrel ensues, and
more money is borrowed, so as to increase the debt. In addition to the
B&#275;hara and N&#257;yako, there are, in some places, other officials
called Adhik&#257;ri or Chowdri, or Bodoporicha and Bhollobhaya. The
caste title is N&#257;yako. Members of higher castes are sometimes,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>especially if they have committed adultery with
Haddi women, received into the caste.</p>
<p>Girls are married after puberty. Though contrary to the usual Oriya
custom, the practice of m&#275;narikam, or marriage with the maternal
uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is permitted. When the marriage of a young man
is contemplated, his father, accompanied by members of his caste,
proceeds to the home of the intended bride. If her parents are in
favour of the match, a small space is cleared in front of the house,
and cow-dung water smeared over it. On this spot the young man&rsquo;s
party deposit a pot of toddy, over which women throw <i>Zizyphus
Jujuba</i> leaves and rice, crying at the same time Ulu-ula. The
village officials, and a few respected members of the caste, assemble
in the house, and, after the engagement has been announced, indulge in
a drink. On an auspicious day, the bridegroom&rsquo;s party go to the
home of the bride, and place, on a new cloth spread on the floor, the
bride-price (usually twenty rupees), and seven betel leaves, myrabolams
(<i>Terminalia</i> fruits), areca nuts, and cakes. Two or three of the
nuts are then removed from the cloth, cut up, and distributed among the
leading men. After the wedding day has been fixed, an adjournment is
made to the toddy shop. In some cases, the marriage ceremony is very
simple, the bride being conducted to the home of the bridegroom, where
a feast is held. In the more elaborate form of ceremonial, the
contracting couple are seated on a dais, and the B&#275;hara or
N&#257;yako, who officiates as priest, makes fire (h&#333;mam) before
them, which he feeds with twigs of <i>Zizyphus Jujuba</i> and
<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>. Mokuttos (forehead chaplets) and
wrist-threads are tied on the couple, and their hands are connected by
the priest by means of a turmeric-dyed thread, and then disconnected by
an unmarried girl. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>The bride&rsquo;s brother arrives on the
scene, dressed up as a woman, and strikes the bridegroom. This is
called solabidha, and is practiced by many Oriya castes. The ends of
the cloths of the bride and bridegroom are tied together, and they are
conducted inside the house, the mother-in-law throwing <i>Zizyphus</i>
leaves and rice over them.</p>
<p>Like other Oriya castes, the Haddis observe pollution for seven days
on the occasion of the first menstrual period. On the first day, the
girl is seated, and, after she has been smeared with oil and turmeric
paste, seven women throw <i>Zizyphus</i> leaves and rice over her. She
is kept either in a corner of the house, or in a separate hut, and has
by her a piece of iron and a grinding-stone wrapped up in a cloth. If
available, twigs of <i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i> are placed in a corner.
Within the room or hut, a small framework, made of broom-sticks and
pieces of palmyra palm leaf, or a bow, is placed, and worshipped daily.
If the girl is engaged to be married, her future father-in-law is
expected to give her a new cloth on the seventh day.</p>
<p>The Haddis are worshippers of various T&#257;kur&#257;nis (village
deities), <i>e.g.</i>, Kalumuki, Sathabavuni, and Baidaro. Cremation of
the dead is more common than burial. Food is offered to the deceased on
the day after death, and also on the tenth and eleventh days. Some
Haddis proceed, on the tenth day, to the spot where the corpse was
cremated or buried, and, after making an effigy on the ground, offer
food. Towards night, they proceed to some distance from the house, and
place food and fruits on a cloth spread on the ground. They then call
the dead man by his name, and eagerly wait till some insect settles on
the cloth. As soon as this happens, the cloth is folded up, carried
home, and shaken over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>floor close to the spot where the
household gods are kept, so that the insect falls on sand spread on the
floor. A light is then placed on the sanded floor, and covered with a
new pot. After some time, the pot is removed, and the sand examined for
any marks which may be left on it. This ceremony seems to correspond to
the jola jola handi (pierced pot) ceremony of other castes (<i>see</i>
Bhond&#257;ri).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rellis,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7391src" href="#xd21e7391" name="xd21e7391src">1</a>
&ldquo;are a caste of gardeners and labourers, found chiefly in the
districts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam. In Telugu the word relli or rellis
means grass, but whether there is any connection between this and the
caste name I cannot say. They generally live at the foot of the hills,
and sell vegetables, mostly of hill production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on the Rellis of Vizagapatam, I am indebted
to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The Rellis are also known as Sachchari, and
they further call themselves Sapiri. The caste recognises the custom of
m&#275;narikam, by which a man marries his maternal uncle&rsquo;s
daughter. A girl is usually married after puberty. The bride-price is
paid sometime before the day fixed for the marriage. On that day, the
bride goes, with her parents, to the house of the bridegroom. The caste
deities Odda P&#333;lamma (commonly known as Sapiri Daivam) and Kanaka
Durg&#257;lamma are invoked by the elders, and a pig and sheep are
sacrificed to them. A string of black beads is tied by the bridegroom
round the bride&rsquo;s neck, and a feast is held, at which the
sacrificed animals are eaten, and much liquor is imbibed. On the
following morning, a new cloth, kunkumam (red powder), and a few pieces
of turmeric are placed in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href=
"#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>small basket or winnow, and
carried in procession, to the accompaniment of music, through the
streets by the bride, with whom is the bridegroom. The ceremony is
repeated on the third day, when the marriage festivities come to an
end. In a note on the Rellis of Ganjam, Mr. S. P. Rice writes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7398src" href="#xd21e7398" name="xd21e7398src">2</a>
that &ldquo;the bridegroom, with the permission of the Village
Magistrate, marches straight into the bride&rsquo;s house, and ties a
wedding necklace round her neck. A gift of seven and a half rupees and
a pig to the castemen, and of five rupees to the bride&rsquo;s father,
completes this very primitive ceremony.&rdquo; Widows are allowed to
remarry, but the string of beads is not tied round the neck. The caste
deities are usually represented by crude wooden dolls, and an annual
festival in their honour, with the sacrifice of pigs and sheep, is held
in March. The dead are usually buried, and, as a rule, pollution is not
observed. Some Rellis have, however, begun to observe the
chinnar&#333;zu (little day) death ceremony, which corresponds to the
chinnadinamu ceremony of the Telugus. The main occupation of the caste
is gardening, and selling fruits and vegetables. The famine of
1875&ndash;76 reduced a large number of Rellis to the verge of
starvation, and they took to scavenging as a means of earning a living.
At the present day, the gardeners look down on the scavengers, but a
prosperous scavenger can be admitted into their society by paying a sum
of money, or giving a feast. Pollution attaches only to the scavengers,
and not to the gardening section. In the Census Report, 1901, the
P&#257;kais or sweepers in the God&#257;vari district, who have, it is
said, gone thither from Vizagapatam, are returned as a sub-caste of
Relli. The usual title of the Rellis is G&#257;du. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Haddis who inhabit the southern part of Ganjam are known as
Gh&#257;sis by other castes, especially Telugu people, though they call
themselves Haddis. The name Gh&#257;si has reference to the occupation
of cutting grass, especially for horses. The occupational title of
grass-cutter is said by Yule and Burnell<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7404src" href="#xd21e7404" name="xd21e7404src">3</a> to be
&ldquo;probably a corruption representing the Hindustani
gh&#257;skod&#257; or gh&#257;sk&#257;t&#257;, the digger or cutter of
grass, the title of a servant employed to collect grass for horses, one
such being usually attached to each horse, besides the syce or
horsekeeper (groom). In the north, the grass-cutter is a man; in the
south the office is filled by the horsekeeper&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; It
is noted in &lsquo;Letters from Madras&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7407src" href="#xd21e7407" name="xd21e7407src">4</a> that
&ldquo;every horse has a man and a maid to himself; the maid cuts grass
for him; and every dog has a boy. I inquired whether the cat had any
servants, but I found he was allowed to wait upon himself.&rdquo; In
addition to collecting and selling grass, the Gh&#257;sis are employed
at scavenging work. Outsiders, even Jaggalis (M&#257;digas), Paidis,
and P&#257;nos, are admitted into the Gh&#257;si community.</p>
<p>The headman of the Gh&#257;sis is called Bissoyi, and he is assisted
by a B&#275;hara and Gonjari. The Gonjari is the caste servant, one of
whose duties is said to be the application of a tamarind switch to the
back of delinquents.</p>
<p>Various exogamous septs or bamsams occur among the Gh&#257;sis, of
which n&#257;ga (cobra), asvo (horse), chintala (tamarind), and liari
(parched rice) may be noted. Adult marriage is the rule. The betrothal
ceremony, at which the kanyo m&#363;lo, or bride-price, is paid, is the
occasion of a feast, at which pork must be served, and the Bissoyi of
the future bride&rsquo;s village ties a konti (gold or silver bead) on
her neck. The marriage ceremonial corresponds in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>the
main with that of the Haddis elsewhere, but has been to some extent
modified by the Telugu environment. The custom, referred to by Mr. S.
P. Rice, of suspending an earthen pot filled with water from the
marriage booth is a very general one, and not peculiar to the
Gh&#257;sis. It is an imitation of a custom observed by the higher
Oriya castes. The striking of the bridegroom on the back by the
bride&rsquo;s brother is the solabidha of other castes, and the mock
anger (rusy&#257;no) in which the latter goes away corresponds to the
alagi povadam of Telugu castes.</p>
<p>At the first menstrual ceremony of a Gh&#257;si girl, she sits in a
space enclosed by four arrows, round which a thread is passed seven
times.</p>
<p>The name Odiya T&#333;ti (Oriya scavenger) occurs as a Tamil synonym
for Haddis employed as scavengers in Municipalities in the Tamil
country.</p>
<p><b>Haj&#257;m.</b>&mdash;The Hindustani name for a barber, and used
as a general professional title by barbers of various classes. It is
noted, in the Census Reports, that only fifteen out of more than two
thousand individuals returned as Haj&#257;m were Muhammadans, and that,
in South Canara, Haj&#257;ms are Konkani Kelasis, and of Mar&#257;thi
descent.</p>
<p><b>Halaba.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Pentiya.</p>
<p><b>Halavakki.</b>&mdash;A Canarese synonym for
B&#363;dubudukala.</p>
<p><b>Hal&#275;paik.</b>&mdash;The Hal&#275;paiks are Canarese
toddy-drawers, who are found in the northern t&#257;luks of the South
Canara district. The name is commonly derived from hale, old, and
paika, a soldier, and it is said that they were formerly employed as
soldiers. There is a legend that one of their ancestors became
commander of the Vijayanagar army, was made ruler of a State,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>and given a village named Halepaikas as a jaghir
(hereditary assignment of land). Some Hal&#275;paiks say that they
belong to the Tengina (cocoanut palm) section, because they are engaged
in tapping that palm for toddy.</p>
<p>There is intermarriage between the Canarese-speaking Hal&#275;paiks
and the Tulu-speaking Billava toddy-drawers, and, in some places, the
Billavas also call themselves Hal&#275;paiks. The Hal&#275;paiks have
exogamous septs or balis, which run in the female line. As examples of
these, the following may be noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>Chendi (<i>Cerbera Odollum</i>), Honn&#275; (<i>Calophyllum
inophyllum</i>), Tolar (wolf), D&#275;vana (god) and Ganga. It is
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7452src" href="#xd21e7452" name=
"xd21e7452src">5</a> of the Hal&#275;paiks of the Canara district in
the Bombay Presidency that &ldquo;each exogamous section, known as a
bali (literally a creeper), is named after some animal or tree, which
is held sacred by the members of the same. This animal, tree or flower,
etc., seems to have been once considered the common ancestor of the
members of the bali, and to the present day it is both worshipped by
them, and held sacred in the sense that they will not injure it. Thus
the members of the n&#257;gbali, named apparently after the
n&#257;gchampa flower, will not wear this flower in their hair, as this
would involve injury to the plant. The Kadav&#275;bali will not kill
the sambhar (deer: kadav&#275;), from which they take their
name.&rdquo; The Hal&#275;paiks of South Canara seem to attach no such
importance to the sept names. Some, however, avoid eating a fish called
Sriniv&#257;sa, because they fancy that the streaks on the body have a
resemblance to the Vaishnavite sectarian mark (n&#257;mam).</p>
<p>All the Hal&#275;paiks of the Kundap&#363;r t&#257;luk profess to be
Vaishnavites, and have become the disciples of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>Vaishnava Br&#257;hman settled in the village of
Sankarappak&#333;dlu near Wondse in that t&#257;luk. Though
Venkataramana is regarded as their chief deity, they worship
Baiderkulu, Panjurli, and other bh&#363;thas (devils). The
P&#363;j&#257;ris (priests) avoid eating new grain, new areca nuts, new
sugarcane, cucumbers and pumpkins, until a feast, called kaidha
p&#363;ja, has been held. This is usually celebrated in
November-December, and consists in offering food, etc., to Baiderkulu.
Somebody gets possessed by the bh&#363;tha, and pierces his abdomen
with an arrow.</p>
<p>In their caste organisation, marriage and death ceremonies, the
Hal&#275;paiks closely follow the Billavas. They do not, however,
construct a car for the final death ceremonies. As they are
Vaishnavites, after purification from death pollution by their own
caste barber, a Vaishnavite mendicant, called D&#257;ssaya, is called
in, and purifies them by sprinkling holy water and putting the
n&#257;mam on their foreheads.</p>
<p>There are said to be some differences between the Hal&#275;paiks and
Billavas in the method of carrying out the process of drawing toddy.
For example, the Hal&#275;paiks generally grasp the knife with the
fingers directed upwards and the thumb to the right, while the Billavas
hold the knife with the fingers directed downwards and the thumb to the
left. For crushing the flower-buds within the spathe of the palm,
Billavas generally use a stone, and the Hal&#275;paiks a bone. There is
a belief that, if the spathe is beaten with the bone of a buffalo which
has been killed by a tiger, the yield of toddy will, if the bone has
not touched the ground, be greater than if an ordinary bone is used.
The Billavas generally carry a long gourd, and the Hal&#275;paiks a
pot, for collecting the toddy in. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323"

<p><b>H&#257;lu</b> (milk).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Holeya and
Kurni, a sub-division of Kuruba, and a name for Vakkaligas who keep
cattle and sell milk. H&#257;lu mata (milk caste) has been given as a
synonym for Kuruba. In the Mysore Census Report, 1901, H&#257;lu
Vakkal-Makkalu, or children of the milk caste, occurs as a synonym for
H&#257;lu Vakkaliga, and, in the South Canara Manual,
H&#257;lvaklumakkalu is given as a synonym for Gauda. The M&#257;digas
call the intoxicant toddy h&#257;lu. (<i>See</i> P&#257;l.)</p>

the founder of the fourth orthodox sect of the Sunnis, who was born at
Baghd&#257;d A.H. 164 (A.D. 780). &ldquo;His fame began to spread just
at the time when disputes ran highest concerning the nature of the
Qur&rsquo;&#257;n, which some held to have existed from eternity,
whilst others maintained it to be created. Unfortunately for Ibn
Hanbal, the Khal&#299;fah-at-Muttasim was of the latter opinion, to
which this doctor refusing to subscribe, he was imprisoned, and
severely scourged by the Khal&#299;fah&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;<a class=

<p><b>H&#257;ruvar.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of the Badagas of the

<p><b>Hasala.</b>&mdash;Concerning the Hasalas or Hasulas, Mr. Lewis
Rice writes that &ldquo;this tribe resembles the S&#333;liga (or
Sh&#333;lagas). They are met with along the gh&acirc;ts on the
north-western frontier of Mysore. They are a short, thick-set race,
very dark in colour, and with curled hair. Their chief employment is
felling timber, but they sometimes work in areca nut gardens and gather
wild cardamoms, pepper, etc. They speak a dialect of
Canarese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Mysore Census Report, 1891, it is stated that &ldquo;the
Hasalaru and Mal&#275;ru are confined to the wild regions of the
Western Maln&#257;d. In the caste generation, they are said to rank
above the Hal&#275;paik&#257;s, but above the Holeyas and M&#257;digas.
They are a diminutive but muscular race, with curly hair and
dolichocephalous head. Their mother-tongue is Tulu. Their numbers are
so insignificantly small as not to be separately defined. They are
immigrants from South Canara, and lead a life little elevated above
that of primordial barbarism. They live in small isolated huts, which
are, however, in the case of the Hasal&#257;s, provided not only with
the usual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>principal entrance, through which one has to
crawl in, but also with a half-concealed hole in the rear, a kind of
postern, through which the shy inmates steal out into the jungle at the
merest suspicion of danger, or the approach of a stranger. They collect
the wild jungle produce, such as cardamoms, etc., for their customary
employers, whose agrestic slaves they have virtually become. Their huts
are annually or periodically shifted from place to place, usually the
most inaccessible and thickest parts of the wilderness. They are said
to be very partial to toddy and arrack (alcoholic liquor). It is
expected that these savages smuggle across the frontier large
quantities of wild pepper and cardamoms from the gh&#257;t forests of
the province. Their marriage customs are characterised by the utmost
simplicity, and the part played therein by the astrologer is not very
edifying. Their religion does not seem to transcend devil worship. They
bury the dead. A very curious obsequial custom prevails among the
Hasalas. When any one among them dies, somebody&rsquo;s devil is
credited with the mishap, and the astrologer is consulted to ascertain
its identity. The latter throws cowries (shells of <i>Cypr&oelig;a
moneta</i>) for divination, and mentions some neighbour as the owner of
the devil thief. Thereupon, the spirit of the dead is redeemed by the
heir or relative by means of a pig, fowl, or other guerdon. The spirit
is then considered released, and is thence forward domiciled in a pot,
which is supplied periodically with water and nourishment. This may be
looked upon as the elementary germ of the posthumous care-taking, which
finds articulation under the name of sr&#257;dh in multifarious forms,
accompanied more or less with much display in the more civilised
sections of the Hindu community. The Hasalaru are confined to
T&#299;rthahalli and M&#363;digere.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is further recorded in the Mysore Census Report, 1891, that
&ldquo;in most of the purely Maln&#257;d or hilly t&#257;luks, each
vargd&#257;r, or proprietor of landed estate, owns a set of servants
styled Hutt&#257;lu or Huttu-&#257;lu and Mann&#257;lu or
Mannu-&#257;lu. The former is the hereditary servitor of the family,
born in servitude, and performing agricultural work for the landholder
from father to son. The Mann&#257;lu is a serf attached to the soil,
and changes hands with it. They are usually of the Holaya class, but,
in some places, the Hasalar race have been entertained.&rdquo;
(<i>See</i> Holeya.)</p>
<p>Concerning the Hasalaru, Mr. H. V. Nanjundayya writes to me that
&ldquo;their marriages take place at night, a p&#363;j&#257;ri of their
caste ties the t&#257;li, a golden disc, round the bride&rsquo;s neck.
Being influenced by the surrounding castes, they have taken of late to
the practice of inviting the astrologer to be present. In the social
scale they are a little superior to M&#257;digas and Holeyas, and, like
them, live outside the village, but they do not eat beef. Their
approach is considered to defile a Br&#257;hman, and they do not enter
the houses of non-Br&#257;hmans such as Vakkaligas and Kurubas. They
have their own caste barbers and washermen, and have separate wells to
draw water from.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Heggade.</b>&mdash;The Heggades are summed up, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as being a class of Canarese cultivators and
cattle-breeders. Concerning the Heggades of South Canara, Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7580src" href="#xd21e7580"
name="xd21e7580src">8</a> that they &ldquo;are classified as shepherds,
but the present occupation of the majority of them is cultivation.
Their social position is said to be somewhat inferior to that of the
Bants. They employ Br&#257;hmins as their priests. In their ceremonies,
the rich follow closely the Brahminical customs. On the second day of
their marriage, a pretence of stealing a jewel from the person of the
bride is made. The bridegroom makes away with the jewel before dawn,
and in the evening the bride&rsquo;s party proceeds to the house where
the bridegroom is to be found. The owner of the house is told that a
theft has occurred in the bride&rsquo;s house and is asked whether the
thief has taken shelter in his house. A negative answer is given, but
the bride&rsquo;s party conducts a regular search. In the meanwhile a
boy is dressed to represent the bridegroom. The searching party mistake
this boy for the bridegroom, arrest him, and produce him before the
audience as the culprit. This disguised bridegroom, who is proclaimed
to be the thief, throws his mask at the bride, when it is found to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>the amusement of all present that he is not the
bridegroom. The bride&rsquo;s party then, confessing their inability to
find the bridegroom, request the owner of the house to produce him. He
is then produced, and conducted in procession to the bride&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Bants who use the title Heggade wear the sacred thread, follow
the hereditary profession of temple functionaries, and are keepers of
the demon shrines which are dotted all over South Canara.</p>
<p>Of the Heggades who have settled in the Coorg country, the Rev. G.
Richter states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7589src" href="#xd21e7589"
name="xd21e7589src">9</a> that &ldquo;they conform, in superstitions
and festivals, to Coorg custom, but are excluded from the community of
the Coorgs, in whose presence they are allowed to sit only on the
floor, whilst the former occupy a chair, or, if they are seated on a
mat, the Heggades must not touch it.&rdquo; In the Mysore and Coorg
Gazetteer, Heggade is defined by Mr. L. Rice as the headman of a
village, the head of the village police, to whom, in some parts of the
Province, rent-free lands are assigned for his support.</p>

the custodians of village histories. They generally arrive at the

blankets. They go from house to house, giving the history of the
different families, the names of heroes who died in war, and so forth.

<p><b>Holadava.</b>&mdash;A synonym of Gatti.</p>
<p><b>Holeya.</b>&mdash;The bulk of the Holeyas are, in the Madras
Presidency, found in South Canara, but there are a considerable number
in Coimbatore and on the N&#299;lgiris (working on cinchona, tea, and
coffee estates). In the Manual of the South Canara district it is noted
that &ldquo;Holeyas are the field labourers, and former agrestic serfs
of South Canara, Pulayan being the Malay&#257;lam and Paraiyan the
Tamil form of the same word. The name is derived by Br&#257;hmins from
hol&#275;, pollution, and by others from hola, land or soil, in
recognition of the fact that, as in the case of the Paraiyan, there are
customs remaining which seem to indicate that the Holeyas were once
masters of the land; but, whatever the derivation may be, it is no
doubt the same as that of Paraiyan and Pulayan. The Holeyas are divided
into many sub-divisions, but the most important are M&#257;ri,
M&#275;ra, and Mundala or B&#257;kuda. The M&#275;ra Holeyas are the
most numerous, and they follow the ordinary law of inheritance through
males, as far as that can be said to be possible with a class of people
who have absolutely nothing to inherit. Of course, demon propitiation
(bh&#363;ta worship) is practically the exclusive idea of the Holeyas,
and every one of the above sub-divisions has four or five demons to
which fowls, beaten rice, cocoanuts and toddy, are offered monthly and
annually. The Holeyas have, like other classes of South Canara, a
number of balis (exogamous septs), and persons of the same bali cannot
intermarry. Though the marriage tie is as loose as is usual among the
depressed and low castes of Southern India, their marriage ceremony is
somewhat elaborate. The bridegroom&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>party goes to the bride&rsquo;s house on a fixed
day with rice, betel leaf and a few areca nuts, and waits the whole
night outside the bride&rsquo;s hut, the bridegroom being seated on a
mat specially made by the bride. On the next morning the bride is made
to sit opposite the bridegroom, with a winnowing fan between them
filled with betel leaf, etc. Meanwhile the men and women present throw
rice over the heads of the couple. The bride then accompanies the
bridegroom to his hut, carrying the mat with her. On the last day the
couple take the mat to a river or tank where fish may be found, dip the
mat into the water, and catch some fish, which they let go after
kissing them. A grand feast completes the marriage. Divorce is easy,
and widow marriage is freely practiced. Holeyas will eat flesh
including beef, and have no caste scruples regarding the consumption of
spirituous liquor. Both men and women wear a small cap made of the leaf
of the areca palm.&rdquo; The Holeyas who were interviewed by us all
said that they do not go through the ceremony of catching fish, which
is performed by Shivalli Br&#257;hmans and Akkas&#257;les.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Tulu Br&#257;hmin chronicles,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7631src" href="#xd21e7631" name=
"xd21e7631src">10</a> &ldquo;agree in ascribing the creation of Malabar
and Canara, or K&#275;rala, Tuluva, and Haiga to Parasu R&#257;ma, who
reclaimed from the sea as much land as he could cover by hurling his
battle-axe from the top of the Western Ghauts. A modified form of the
tradition states that Parasu R&#257;ma gave the newly reclaimed land to
N&#257;ga and Machi Br&#257;hmins, who were not true Br&#257;hmins, and
were turned out or destroyed by fishermen and Holeyas, who held the
country till the Tulu Br&#257;hmins were introduced by May&#363;r Varma
(of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>Kadamba dynasty). All traditions unite in
attributing the introduction of the Tulu Br&#257;hmins of the present
day to May&#363;r Varma, but they vary in details connected with the
manner in which they obtained a firm footing in the land. One account
says that Hab&#257;shika, chief of the Koragas, drove out May&#363;r
Varma, but was in turn expelled by May&#363;r Varma&rsquo;s son, or
son-in-law, L&#333;k&#257;ditya of G&#333;karnam, who brought
Br&#257;hmins from Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra, and settled them in thirty-two
villages. Another makes May&#363;r Varma himself the invader of the
country, which till then had remained in the possession of the Holeyas
and fishermen who had turned out Parasu R&#257;ma&rsquo;s
Br&#257;hmins. May&#363;r Varma and the Br&#257;hmins whom he had
brought from Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra were again driven out by Nanda, a Holeya
chief, whose son Chandra Sayana had, however, learned respect for
Br&#257;hmins from his mother, who had been a dancing-girl in a temple.
His admiration for them became so great that he not only brought back
the Br&#257;hmins, but actually made over all his authority to them,
and reduced his people to the position of slaves. A third account makes
Chandra Sayana, not a son of a Holeya king, but a descendant of
May&#363;r Varma and a conqueror of the Holeya king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Coorg, the Rev. G. Richter writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7638src" href="#xd21e7638" name="xd21e7638src">11</a> &ldquo;the
Holeyas are found in the Coorg houses all over the country, and do all
the menial work for the Coorgs, by whom, though theoretically freemen
under the British Government, they were held as <i>gleb&oelig;
adscripti</i> in a state of abject servitude until lately, when, with
the advent of European planters, the slave question was freely
discussed, and the &lsquo;domestic institution&rsquo; practically
abolished. The Holeyas dress indifferently, are of dirty habits, and
eat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>whatever they can get, beef included. Their
worship is addressed to Eiyappa D&#275;varu and Ch&#257;mundi, or
K&#257;li goddess once every month; and once every year they sacrifice
a hog or a fowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Holeyas of the Mysore province, the following account is
given in the Mysore Census Reports, 1891 and 1901. &ldquo;The Holeyas
number 502,493 persons, being 10.53 per cent. of the total population.
They constitute, as their name implies, the back-bone of cultivation in
the country. Hola is the Kanarese name for a dry-crop field, and Holeya
means the man of such field. The caste has numerous sub-divisions,
among which are Kannada, Gangadik&#257;ra, Maggada (loom), and Morasu.
The Holeyas are chiefly employed as labourers in connection with
agriculture, and manufacture with hand-looms various kinds of coarse
cloth or home-spun, which are worn extensively by the poorer classes,
notwithstanding that they are being fast supplanted by foreign cheap
fabrics. In some parts of the Mysore district, considerable numbers of
the Holeyas are specially engaged in betel-vine gardening. As labourers
they are employed in innumerable pursuits, in which manual labour
preponderates. The Al&#275;man sub-division furnishes recruits as Barr
sepoys. It may not be amiss to quote here some interesting facts
denoting the measure of material well-being achieved by, and the
religious recognition accorded to the outcastes at certain first-class
shrines in Mysore. At M&#275;lk&#333;t&#275; in the Mysore district,
the outcastes, <i>i.e.</i>, the Holeyas and M&#257;digs, are said to
have been granted by the great Visisht&#257;dvaita reformer,
R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;ch&#257;rya, the privilege of entering the
Vishnu temple up to the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, along with
Br&#257;hmans and others, to perform worship there for three days
during the annual car procession. The following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>anecdote, recorded by Buchanan,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7656src" href="#xd21e7656" name=
"xd21e7656src">12</a> supplies the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for
the concession, which is said to have also been earned by their
forebears having guarded the sacred m&#363;rti or idol. On
R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;ch&#257;rya going to Melk&#333;ta to perform his
devotions at that celebrated shrine, he was informed that the place had
been attacked by the Turk King of Delhi, who had carried away the idol.
The Br&#257;hman immediately set out for that capital, and on arrival
found that the King had made a present of the image to his daughter,
for it is said to be very handsome, and she asked for it as a
plaything. All day the princess played with the image, and at night the
god assumed his own beautiful form, and enjoyed her bed, for Krishna is
addicted to such forms of adventures.
R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;ch&#257;rya, by virtue of certain mantras,
obtained possession of the image, and wished to carry it off. He asked
the Br&#257;hmans to assist him, but they refused; on which the Holeyas
volunteered, provided the right of entering the temple was granted to
them. R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;ch&#257;rya accepted their proposal, and
the Holeyas, having posted themselves between Delhi and
M&#275;lk&#333;ta, the image of the god was carried down in twenty-four
hours. The service also won for the outcastes the envied title of
Tiru-kulam or the sacred race. In 1799, however, when the Dew&#257;n
(prime minister) P&#363;rnaiya visited the holy place, the right of the
outcastes to enter the temple was stopped at the dhvaja stambham, the
consecrated monolithic column, from which point alone can they now
obtain a view of the god. On the day of the car procession, the
Tiru-kulam people, men, women and children, shave their heads and bathe
with the higher castes in the kaly&#257;ni or large reservoir, and
carry on their head small <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href=
"#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>earthen vessels filled with rice
and oil, and enter the temple as far as the flagstaff referred to
above, where they deliver their offerings, which are appropriated by
the D&#257;sayyas, who resort simultaneously as pilgrims to the shrine.
Besides the privilege of entering the temple, the Tiru-kula Holeyas and
M&#257;digs have the right to drag the car, for which service they are
requited by getting from the temple two hundred seers of r&#257;gi
(grain), a quantity of jaggery (crude sugar), and few bits of the dyed
cloth used for decorating the pandal (shed) which is erected for the
procession. At the close of the procession, the representatives of the
aforesaid classes receive each a flower garland at the hands of the
Sth&#257;nik or chief worshipper, who manages to drop a garland
synchronously into each plate held by the recipients, so as to avoid
any suspicion of undue preference. In return for these privileges, the
members of the Tiru-kulam used to render gratuitous services such as
sweeping the streets round the temple daily, and in the night
patrolling the whole place with drums during the continuance of the
annual procession, etc. But these services are said to have become much
abridged and nearly obsolete under the recent police and municipal
r&eacute;gime. The privilege of entering the temple during the annual
car procession is enjoyed also by the outcastes in the Vishnu temple at
B&#275;l&#363;r in the Hassan district. It is, however, significant
that in both the shrines, as soon as the car festival is over,
<i>i.e.</i>, on the 10th day, the concession ceases, and the temples
are ceremonially purified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the pre-survey period, the Holeya or M&#257;dig
Kulv&#257;di, in the maid&#257;n or eastern division, was so closely
identified with the soil that his oath, accompanied by certain
formalities and awe-inspiring solemnities, was considered to give the
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to long existing and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>vexatious boundary disputes. He had a potential
voice in the internal economy of the village, and was often the
<i>fidus Achates</i> of the patel (village official). In the
maln&#257;d, however, the Holeya had degenerated into the agrestic
slave, and till a few decades ago under the British rule, not only as
regards his property, but also with regard to his body, he was not his
own master. The vargd&#257;r or landholder owned him as a hereditary
slave. The genius of British rule has emancipated him, and his
enfranchisement has been emphasized by the allurements of the coffee
industry with its free labour and higher wages. It is, however, said
that the improvement so far of the status of the outcastes in the
maln&#257;d has not been an unmixed good, inasmuch as it is likewise a
measure of the decadence of the sup&#257;ri (betel) gardens. Be that as
it may, the Holeya in the far west of the province still continues in
many respects the bondsman of the local landholder of influence; and
some of the social customs now prevailing among the Holeyas there, as
described hereunder, fully bear out this fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most of the purely maln&#257;d or hilly taluks, each
vargd&#257;r, or proprietor of landed estate, owns a set of servants
called Hutt&#257;lu or Huttu-&#256;lu and Mann&#257;lu or
Mannu-&#256;lu. The former is the hereditary servitor of the family,
born in servitude, and performing agricultural work for the landholder
from father to son. The Mann&#257;lu is a serf attached to the soil,
and changes with it. These are usually of the Holeya class, but in some
places men of the Hasalar race have been entertained. To some estates
or vargs only Huttu-&#257;l&#363;s are attached, while
Mannu-&#257;l&#363;s work on others. Notwithstanding the measure of
personal freedom enjoyed by all men at the present time, and the
unification of the land tenures in the province under the revenue
survey and settlement, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href=
"#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>the traditions of birth,
immemorial custom, ignorance, and never-to-be-paid-off loads of debt,
tend to preserve in greater or less integrity the conditions of
semi-slavery under which these agrestic slaves live. It is locally
considered the acme of unwisdom to loosen the immemorial relations
between capital and labour, especially in the remote backwoods, in
which free labour does not exist, and the rich sup&#257;ri cultivation
whereof would be ruined otherwise. In order furthermore to rivet the
ties which bind these hereditary labourers to the soil, it is alleged
that the local capitalists have improvised a kind of Gretna Green
marriage among them. A legal marriage of the orthodox type contains the
risk of a female servant being lost to the family in case the husband
happened not to be a Hutt&#257;lu or Mann&#257;lu. So, in order to
obviate the possible loss, a custom prevails according to which a
female Hutt&#257;lu or Mann&#257;lu is espoused in what is locally
known as the manikattu form, which is neither more nor less than
licensed concubinage. She may be given up after a time, subject to a
small fine to the caste, and anybody else may then espouse her on like
conditions. Not only does she then remain in the family, but her
children will also become the landlord&rsquo;s servants. These people
are paid with a daily supply of paddy or cooked food, and a yearly
present of clothing and blankets (kamblis). On special occasions, and
at car feasts, they receive in addition small money allowances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In rural circles, in which the Holeyas and M&#257;digs are
kept at arm&rsquo;s length by the Br&#257;manical bodies, and are not
allowed to approach the sacerdotal classes beyond a fixed limit, the
outcastes maintain a strict semi-religious rule, whereby no
Br&#257;hman can enter the Holeya&rsquo;s quarters without
necessitating a purification thereof. They believe that the direst
calamities will befall them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>and theirs if otherwise. The
ultraconservative spirit of Hindu priestcraft casts into the far
distance the realization of the hope that the lower castes will become
socially equal even with the classes usually termed S&#363;dr&#257;s.
But the time is looming in the near distance, in which they will be on
a level in temporal prosperity with the social organisms above them.
Unlike the land tenures said to prevail in Chingleput or Madras, the
Mysore system fully permits the Holeyas and M&#257;digs to hold land in
their own right, and as sub-tenants they are to be found almost
everywhere. The highest amount of land assessment paid by a single
Holeya is Rs. 279 in the Bangalore district, and the lowest six pies in
the Kolar and Mysore districts. The quota paid by the outcastes towards
the land revenue of the country aggregates no less than three lakhs of
rupees, more than two-thirds being paid by the Holeyas, and the
remainder by the M&#257;digs. These facts speak for themselves, and
afford a reliable index to the comparative well-being of these people.
Instances may also be readily quoted, in which individual Holeyas,
etc., have risen to be money-lenders, and enjoy comparative affluence.
Coffee cultivation and allied industries have thrown much good fortune
into their lap. Here and there they have also established bhajan&#275;
or prayer houses, in which theistic prayers and psalms are recited by
periodical congregation. A beginning has been made towards placing the
facilities of education within easy reach of these depressed
classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the Holeyas of South Canara, it is
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7688src" href="#xd21e7688" name=
"xd21e7688src">13</a> that &ldquo;the ordinary agricultural labourers
of this district are Holeyas or Pariahs of two classes, known as
M&#363;lada Holeyas and S&#257;lada Holeyas, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>former being the old hereditary serfs attached
to M&#363;li wargs (estates), and the latter labourers bound to their
masters&rsquo; service by being in debt to them. Nowadays, however,
there is a little difference between the two classes. Neither are much
given to changing masters, and, though a M&#363;lada Holeya is no
longer a slave, he is usually as much in debt as a S&#257;lada Holeya,
and can only change when his new master takes the debt over. To these
labourers cash payments are unknown, except occasionally in the case of
S&#257;lada Holeyas, where there is a nominal annual payment to be set
off against interest on the debt. In other cases interest is foregone,
one or other of the perquisites being sometimes docked as an
equivalent. The grain wage consists of rice or paddy (unhusked rice),
and the local seer is, on the average, as nearly as possible one of 80
tolas. The daily rice payments to men, women, and children vary as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to the daily wages, and the midday meal of boiled
rice which is given in almost all parts, there are annual perquisites
or privileges. Except on the coast of the Mangalore t&#257;luk and in
the Coondapoor t&#257;luk, every Holeya is allowed rent free from
&#8539; to &#8531; acre of land, and one or two cocoanut or palmyra
trees, with sometimes a jack or mango tree in addition. The money-value
of the produce of this little allotment is variously estimated at from
1 to 5 rupees per annum. Throughout the whole district, cloths are
given every year to each labourer, the money value being estimated at 1
rupee per adult, and 6 annas for a child. It is also customary to give
a cumbly (blanket) in the neighbourhood of the ghauts, where the damp
and cold render a warm covering necessary. On <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>three or four important festivals, presents of
rice and other eatables, oil and salt are given to each labourer, or,
in some cases, to each family. The average value of these may be taken
at 1 rupee per labourer, or Rs. 4 per family. Presents are also made on
the occasion of a birth, marriage, or funeral, the value of which
varies very much in individual cases. Whole families of Holeyas are
attached to the farms, but, when their master does not require their
services, he expects them to go and work elsewhere in places where such
work is to be got. In the interior, outside work is not to be had at
many seasons, and the master has to pay them even if there is not much
for them to do, but, one way or another, he usually manages to keep
them pretty well employed all the year round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Kulw&#257;dis, Kulv&#257;dis or Chalav&#257;dis of
the Hassan district in Mysore, Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7749src" href="#xd21e7749" name=
"xd21e7749src">14</a> that &ldquo;every village has its
Holigiri&mdash;as the quarter inhabited by the Holiars is
called&mdash;outside the village boundary hedge. This, I thought, was
because they are considered an impure race, whose touch carries
defilement with it. Such is the reason generally given by the
Br&#257;hman, who refuses to receive anything directly from the hands
of a Holiar, and yet the Br&#257;hmans consider great luck will wait
upon them if they can manage to pass through the Holigiri without being
molested. To this the Holiars have a strong objection, and, should a
Br&#257;hman attempt to enter their quarters, they turn out in a body
and slipper him, in former times it is said to death. Members of the
other castes may come as far as the door, but they must not enter the
house, for that would bring the Holiar bad luck. If, by chance, a
person happens to get in, the owner takes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>care to tear the
intruder&rsquo;s cloth, tie up some salt in one corner of it, and turn
him out. This is supposed to neutralize all the good luck which might
have accrued to the trespasser, and avert any evil which might have
befallen the owner of the house. All the thousand-and-one castes, whose
members find a home in the village, unhesitatingly admit that the
Kulw&#257;di is <i>de jure</i> the rightful owner of the village. He
who was is still, in a limited sense, &lsquo;lord of the village
manor.&rsquo; If there is a dispute as to the village boundaries, the
Kulw&#257;di is the only one competent to take the oath as to how the
boundary ought to run. The old custom for settling such disputes was as
follows. The Kulw&#257;di, carrying on his head a ball made of the
village earth, in the centre of which is placed some water, passes
along the boundary. If he has kept the proper line, everything goes
well; but should he, by accident, even go beyond his own proper
boundary, then the ball of earth, of its own accord, goes to pieces,
the Kulw&#257;di dies within fifteen days, and his house becomes a
ruin. Such is the popular belief. Again, the skins of all animals dying
within the village boundaries are the property of the Kulw&#257;di, and
a good income he makes from this source. To this day a village boundary
dispute is often decided by this one fact. If the Kulw&#257;dis agree,
the other inhabitants of the villages can say no more. When&mdash;in
our forefathers&rsquo; days, as the natives say&mdash;a village was
first established, a stone called &lsquo;karu kallu&rsquo; is set up.
To this stone the Patel once a year makes an offering. The
Kulw&#257;di, after the ceremony is over, is entitled to carry off the
rice, etc., offered. In cases where there is no Patel, the Kulw&#257;di
goes through the yearly ceremony. But what I think proves strongly that
the Holia was the first to take possession of the soil is that the
Kulw&#257;di receives, and is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341"
href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>entitled to receive, from the
friends of any person who dies in the village, a certain fee or as my
informant forcibly put it, &lsquo;They buy from him the ground for the
dead.&rsquo; This fee is still called in Canarese nela h&#257;ga, from
nela earth, and h&#257;ga, a coin worth 1 anna 2 pies. In Munzerabad
the Kulw&#257;di does not receive this fee from those ryots who are
related to the headman. Here the Kulw&#257;di occupies a higher
position. He has, in fact, been adopted into the Patel&rsquo;s family,
for, on a death occurring in such family, the Kulw&#257;di goes into
mourning by shaving his head. He always receives from the friends the
clothes the deceased wore, and a brass basin. The Kulw&#257;di,
however, owns a superior in the matter of burial fees. He pays yearly a
fowl, one hana (4 annas 8 pies), and a handful of rice to the agent of
the Sudg&#257;du Siddha, or lord of the burning ground
(<i>q.v.</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Kulw&#257;di, whom I came across, was carrying a brass ladle
bearing the figure of a couchant bull (Basava) and a lingam under a
many-headed cobra canopy. This ladle is carried round, and filled with
rice, money, and betel, on the occasion of marriages in those castes,
of which the insignia are engraved on the handle. These insignia were
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Weavers&mdash;Shuttle and brush.</li>
<li>Bestha&mdash;Fish.</li>
<li>Upp&#257;ra&mdash;Spade and basket for collecting salt.</li>
<li>Korama&mdash;Baskets and knife for splitting canes and
bamboos.</li>
<li>&#298;diga&mdash;Knife, and apparatus for climbing palm-trees.</li>
<li>Haj&#257;m&mdash;Barber&rsquo;s scissors, razor, and sharpening
stone.</li>
<li>G&#257;niga&mdash;Oil-press. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342"
href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span></li>
<li>Madav&#257;li&mdash;Washerman&rsquo;s pot, fire-place, mallet, and
stone.</li>
<li>Kumb&#257;ra&mdash;Potter&rsquo;s wheel, pots, and mallet.</li>
<li>Vakkaliga&mdash;Plough.</li>
<li>Chetti&mdash;Scales and basket.</li>
<li>Kuruba&mdash;Sheep-shears.</li>
</ul>
<p>A small whistle, called kola-singan&#257;tha, made of gold, silver,
or copper, is tied round the neck of some Holeyas, Vakkaligas, Besthas,
Agasas and Kurubas, by means of threads of sheep&rsquo;s wool
intertwined sixteen times. All these castes are supposed to belong to
the family of the God Bhaira, in whose name the whistle is tied by a
Bair&#257;gi at Chunchingiri near N&#257;gamangala. It is usually tied
in fulfilment of a vow taken by the parents, and the ceremony costs
from a hundred to two hundred rupees. Until the vow is fulfilled, the
person concerned cannot marry. At the ceremony, the Bair&#257;gi bores
a hole in the right ear-lobe of the celebrant with a needle called
diksha churi, and from the wound ten drops of blood fall to the ground
(<i>cf.</i> J&#333;gi Purusha). He is then bathed before the whistle is
tied round his neck. As the result of wearing the whistle, the man
attains to the rank of a priest in his caste, and is entitled to
receive alms and meals on festive and ceremonial occasions. He blows
his whistle, which emits a thin squeak, before partaking of food, or
performing his daily worship.</p>
<p>It is noted in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, that the marriage of
the Holeyas is &ldquo;nothing but a feast, at which the bridegroom ties
the bottu (marriage badge) round the bride&rsquo;s neck. The wife
cannot be divorced except for adultery. Widows are prohibited from
remarrying, but the caste winks at a widow&rsquo;s living with a
man.&rdquo; In an account given to me of marriage among the
Gangadik&#257;ra Holeyas, I was told that, if a girl <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>reaches puberty without being married, she may
live with any man whom she likes within the caste. If he pays later on
the bride price of twelve rupees, the marriage ceremonies take place,
and the issue becomes legitimate. On the first day of these ceremonies,
the bride is taken to the house of her husband-elect. The parties of
the bride and bridegroom go, accompanied by music, to a river or tank,
each with four new earthen pots, rice, betel, and other things. The
pots, which are decorated with flowers of the areca palm, are filled
with water, and set apart in the houses of the contracting couple. This
ceremonial is known as bringing the god. At night the wrist-threads
(kankanam), made of black and white wool, with turmeric root and iron
ring tied on them, are placed round the wrists of the bride and
bridegroom. On the following day, cotton thread is passed round the
necks of three brass vessels, and also round the head of the
bridegroom, who sits before the vessels with hands folded, and betel
leaves stuck between his fingers. Married women anoint him with oil and
turmeric, and he is bathed. He is then made to stand beneath a tree,
and a twig of the jambu (<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>) tree is tied to the
milk-post. A similar ceremony is performed by the bride. The bridegroom
is conducted to the marriage booth, and he and the bride exchange
garlands and put gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) and jirig&#275; (cummin) on
each other&rsquo;s heads. The bottu is passed round to be blessed, and
tied by the bridegroom on the bride&rsquo;s neck. This is followed by
the pouring of milk over the hands of the contracting couple. On the
third day, the wrist-threads are removed, and the pots thrown away.</p>
<p>The Holeyas have a large number of exogamous septs, of which the
following are examples:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344"

<p>It is recorded in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;351
out of the entire population of 577,166 have returned g&#333;tras, the
names thereof being Harichandra, K&#257;li, Yekke, and Karadi. In thus
doing, it is evident that they are learning to venerate themselves,
like others in admittedly higher grades of society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Holeya families are called Hal&#275; Makkalu, or old children
of the Gangadik&#257;ra Vakkaligas, and have to do certain services for
the latter, such as carrying the sandals of the bridegroom, acting as
messenger in conveying news from place to place, carrying fire before
corpses to the burning-ground, and watching over the burning body. It
is said that, in the performance of these duties, the exogamous septs
of the Holeya and Vakkaliga must coincide.</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Balagai, B&#257;kuda, Beg&#257;ra or
By&#257;g&#257;ra, K&#363;sa (or Upp&#257;ra) M&#257;ila, and
R&#257;nivaya (belonging to a queen) are recorded as sub-sects of the
Holeyas. Of these, Balagai is a synonym, indicating that the Holeyas
belong to the right-hand section. The B&#257;kudas are said to resent
the application of that name to them, and call themselves
Aipattukuladavaru, or the people of fifty families, presumably from the
fact that they are divided into fifty balis or families. These balis
are said to be named after deceased female ancestors. B&#275;g&#257;ra
or By&#257;g&#257;ra is a synonym, applied to the Holeyas by Kanarese
Ling&#257;yats. M&#257;ila means dirt, and probably refers to the
washerman section, just as Mail&#257;ri (washerman) occurs among the
M&#257;las. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tulu-speaking Holeyas must not be confounded with the
Canarese-speaking Holeyas. In South Canara, Holeya is a general name
applied to the polluting classes, Nalkes, Koragas, and the three
divisions of Holeyas proper, which differ widely from each other in
some respects. These divisions are&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) B&#257;kuda or Mundala&mdash;A stranger, asking a woman if her
husband is at home, is expected to refer to him as her B&#257;kuda, and
not as her Mundala.</li>
<li>(2) M&#275;ra or Mugayaru, which is also called Kaipuda.</li>
<li>(3) M&#257;ri or M&#257;rimanisaru.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the first two sections abstain from beef, and consequently
consider themselves superior to the M&#257;ri section.</p>
<p>The B&#257;kudas follow the aliya sant&#257;na law of succession (in
the female line), and, if a man leaves any property, it goes to his
nephew. They will not touch dead cows or calves, or remove the placenta
when a cow calves. Nor will they touch leather, especially in the form
of shoes. They will not carry cots on which rice sheaves are thrashed,
chairs, etc., which have four legs, but, when ordered to do so, either
break off one leg, or add an extra leg by tying a stick to the cot or
chair. The women always wear their cloth in one piece, and are not
allowed, like other Holeyas, to have it made of two pieces. The
B&#257;kudas will not eat food prepared or touched by Bilimaggas,
J&#257;das, Paravas or Nalkes. The headman is called Mukhari. The
office is hereditary, and, in some places, is, as with the Guttinaya of
the Bants, connected with his house-site. This being fixed, he should
remain at that house, or his appointment will lapse, except with the
general consent of the community to his retaining it. In some places,
the Mukhari has two assistants, called Jammana and Bondari, of whom the
latter has to distribute <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>toddy at assemblies of the caste.
On all ceremonial occasions, the Mukhari has to be treated with great
respect, and even an individual who gets possessed by the bh&#363;tha
(devil) has to touch him with his kadasale (sword). In cases of
adultery, a purificatory ceremony, called gudi suddha, is performed.
The erring woman&rsquo;s relations construct seven small huts, through
which she has to pass, and they are burned down. The fact of this
purificatory ceremony taking place is usually proclaimed by the
B&#333;ndari, and the saying is that 280 people should assemble. They
sprinkle water brought from a temple or sthana (devil shrine) and
cow&rsquo;s urine over the woman just before she passes through the
huts. A small quantity of hair from her head, a few hairs from the
eyelids, and nails from her fingers are thrown into the huts. In some
places, the delinquent has to drink a considerable quantity of
salt-water and cow-dung water.</p>
<p>Her relatives have to pay a small money fine to the village deity.
The ordeal of passing through huts is also practiced by the Koragas of
South Canara. &ldquo;The suggestion,&rdquo; Mr. R. E. Enthoven writes,
&ldquo;seems to be a rapid representation of seven existences, the
outcaste regaining his (or her) status after seven generations have
passed without further transgression. The parallel suggested is the law
of Manu that seven generations are necessary to efface a lapse from the
law of endogamous marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The special bh&#363;thas of the B&#257;kudas are Kodababbu and
Kamberlu (or Kangilu), but Jum&#257;di, Panjurli, and Tanimaniya are
also occasionally worshipped. For the propitiation of Kodababbu, Nalkes
are engaged to put on the disguise of this bh&#363;tha, whereas
B&#257;kudas themselves dress up for the propitiation of Kamberlu in
cocoanut leaves tied round the head and waist. Thus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>disguised, they go about the streets
periodically, collecting alms from door to door. Kamberlu is supposed
to cause small-pox, cholera, and other epidemic diseases.</p>
<p>On the day fixed for the betrothal ceremony, among the B&#257;kudas,
a few people assemble at the home of the bride-elect, and the Mukharis
of both parties exchange betel or beat the palms of their hands, and
proclaim that all quarrels must cease, and the marriage is to be
celebrated. Toddy is distributed among those assembled. The
bride&rsquo;s party visit the parents of the bridegroom, and receive
then or subsequently a white cloth, four rupees, and three bundles of
rice. On the wedding day, those who are present seat themselves in
front of the house where the ceremony is to take place, and are given
betel to chew. A new mat is spread, and the bride and bridegroom stand
thereon. If there is a Kodababbu sthana in the vicinity, the jewels
belonging thereto are worn by the bridegroom, who also wears a red cap,
which is usually kept in the sthana, and carries in his hand the sword
(kadasale) belonging thereto. The Mukhari or Jammana asks if the five
groups of people, from Bark&#363;r, Mangalore, Shivalli,
Chithp&#257;di, Mudanidamb&#363;r, and Udayavara, are present. Five men
come forward, and announce that this is so, and say &ldquo;all
relationship involving prohibited degrees may snap, and cease to
exist.&rdquo; A tray of rice and a lamp are placed before the
contracting couple, and those present throw rice over their heads. All
then go to the toddy shop, and have a drink. They then return to the
house and partake of a meal, at which the bridegroom and his bestman
(maternal uncle&rsquo;s son) are seated apart. Cooked rice is heaped up
on a leaf before the bridegroom, and five piles of fish curry are
placed thereon. First the bridegroom eats a portion thereof, and the
remainder is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>finished off by the bestman. The bridal couple
then stand once more on the mat, and the Mukhari joins their hands,
saying &ldquo;No unlawful marriage should take place. Prohibited
relationship must be avoided.&rdquo; He sprinkles water from culms of
<i>Cynodon Dactylon</i> over the united hands.</p>
<p>The body of a dead B&#257;kuda is washed with hot water, in which
mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>) bark is steeped. The dead are buried.
The day for the final death ceremonies (bojja) is usually fixed by the
Mukhari or Jammana. On that day, cooked food is offered to the
deceased, and all cry &ldquo;muriyo, muriyo.&rdquo; The son, after
being shaved, and with his face veiled by a cloth, carries cooked rice
on his head to a small hut erected for the occasion. The food is set
down, and all present throw some of it into the hut.</p>
<p>The M&#275;ra or Mugayar Holeyas, like the B&#257;kudas, abstain
from eating beef, and refuse to touch leather in any form. They have no
objection to carrying four-legged articles. Though their mother tongue
is Tulu, they seem to follow the makkala sant&#257;na law of
inheritance (in the male line). Their headman is entitled Kuruneru, and
he has, as the badge of office, a cane with a silver band. The office
of headman passes to the son instead of to the nephew. Marriage is
called Badathana, and the details of the ceremony are like those of the
M&#257;ri Holeyas. The dead are buried, and the final death ceremonies
(bojja or s&#257;vu) are performed on the twelfth or sixteenth day. A
feast is given to some members of the community, and cooked food
offered to the deceased at the house and near the grave.</p>
<p>The M&#257;ri or M&#257;rimanisaru Holeyas are sometimes called
K&#257;radhi by the B&#257;kudas. Like certain Malay&#257;lam castes,
the Holeyas have distinct names for their homes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>according to the section. Thus, the huts of the
M&#257;ri Holeyas are called kelu, and those of the M&#275;ra Holeyas
patta. The headmen among the M&#257;ri Holeyas are called M&#363;lia,
Boltiy&#257;di, and Kallali. The office of headman follows in the
female line of succession. In addition to various bh&#363;thas, such as
Panjurli and Jum&#257;di, the M&#257;ri Holeyas have two special
bh&#363;thas, named Kattadhe and K&#257;nadhe, whom they regard as
their ancestors. At times of festivals, these ancestors are supposed to
descend on earth, and make their presence known by taking possession of
some member of the community. Men who are liable to be so possessed are
called Dharipuneyi, and have the privilege of taking up the sword and
bell belonging to the bh&#363;thasthana when under possession.</p>
<p>Marriage among the M&#257;ri Holeyas is called porath&#257;vu. At
the betrothal ceremony, the headmen of the contracting parties exchange
betel leaves and areca nuts. The bride-price usually consists of two
bundles of rice and a bundle of paddy (unhusked rice). On the wedding
day the bridegroom and his party go to the home of the bride, taking
with them a basket containing five seers of rice, two metal bangles,
one or two cocoanuts, a comb, and a white woman&rsquo;s cloth, which
are shown to the headman of the bride&rsquo;s party. The two headmen
order betel leaf and areca nuts to be distributed among those
assembled. After a meal, a mat is spread in front of the hut, and the
bride and bridegroom stand thereon. The bridegroom has in his hand a
sword, and the bride holds some betel leaves and areca nuts. Rice is
thrown over their heads, and presents of money are given to them. The
two headmen lift up the hands of the contracting couple, and they are
joined together. The bride is lifted up so as to be a little higher
than the bridegroom, and is taken indoors. The bridegroom follows her,
but is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>prevented from entering by his brother-in-law,
to whom he gives betel leaves and areca nuts. He then makes a forcible
entrance into the hut.</p>
<p>When a M&#257;ri Holeya girl reaches puberty, she is expected to
remain within a hut for twelve days, at the end of which time the
castemen are invited to a feast. The girl is seated on a pattern drawn
on the floor. At the four corners thereof, vessels filled with water
are placed. The girl&rsquo;s mother holds over her head a plantain
leaf, and four women belonging to different balis (septs) pour water
thereon from the vessels. These women and the girl then sit down to a
meal, and eat off the same leaf.</p>
<p>Among the M&#257;ri Holeyas, the dead are usually buried, and the
final death ceremonies are performed on the twelfth day. A pit is dug
near the grave, into which an image of the deceased, made of rice
straw, is put. The image is set on fire by his son or nephew. The ashes
are heaped up, and a rude hut is erected round them by fixing three
sticks in the ground, and covering them with a cloth. Food is offered
on a leaf, and the dead person is asked to eat it.</p>
<p>The K&#363;sa Holeyas speak Canarese. They object to carrying
articles with four legs, unless the legs are crossed. They do not eat
beef, and will not touch leather. They consider themselves to be
superior to the other sections of Holeyas, and use as an argument that
their caste name is Upp&#257;ra, and not Holeya. Why they are called
Upp&#257;ra is not clear, but some say that they are the same as the
Upp&#257;ras (salt workers) of Mysore, who, in South Canara, have
descended in the social scale. The hereditary occupation of the
Upp&#257;ras is making salt from salt earth (ku, earth). The headman of
the K&#363;sa Holeyas is called Buddivant. As they are disciples of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>Ling&#257;yat priest at the mutt at Kudli in
Mysore, they are Saivites. Every family has to pay the priest a fee of
eight annas on the occasion of his periodical visitations. The
bh&#363;thas specially worshipped by the K&#363;sa Holeyas are Masti
and H&#257;lemanedeyya, but Venkatar&#257;mana of Tirupati is by some
regarded as their family deity. Marriage is both infant and adult, and
widows are permitted to remarry, if they have no children.</p>
<p>At Tumk&#363;r, in the Mysore Province, I came across a settlement
of people called Tigala Holeya, who do not intermarry with other
Holeyas, and have no exogamous septs or house-names. Their cranial
measurements approach more nearly to those of the dolichocephalic Tamil
Paraiyans than those of the sub-brachycephalic Holeyas; and it is
possible that they are Tamil Paraiyans, who migrated, at some distant
date, to Mysore.</p>

sylvestris</i>).&mdash;&#298;chcham or &#298;chanj&#257;n&#257;r is
recorded, in the Tanjore Manual, as a section of Sh&#257;n&#257;n. The
equivalent &#298;chang occurs as a tree or kothu of
Kondaiyank&#333;ttai Maravans.</p>
<p><b>Idach&#275;ri.</b>&mdash;An occupational name for a section of
N&#257;yars, who make and sell dairy produce. The word corresponds to
Idaiyan in the Tamil country.</p>
<p><b>Idaiyan.</b>&mdash;The Idaiyans are the great pastoral or
shepherd caste of the Tamil country, but some are landowners, and a few
are in Government employ. Those whom I examined at Coimbatore were
engaged as milkmen, shepherds, cultivators, gardeners, cart-drivers,
shopkeepers, constables, family doctors, and mendicants.</p>
<p>It is recorded in the Tanjore Manual that &ldquo;the Rev. Mr. Pope
says that Ideir are so-called from idei, middle, being a kind of
intermediate link between the farmers and merchants.&rdquo; Mr.
Nelson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8020src" href="#xd21e8020" name=
"xd21e8020src">1</a> considers this derivation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>to
be fanciful, and thinks that &ldquo;perhaps they are so called from
originally inhabiting the lands which lay midway between the hills and
the arable lands, the jungly plains, suited for pasturage [<i>i.e.</i>,
the middle land out of the five groups of land mentioned in Tamil
works, viz., Kurinji, P&#257;lai, Mullai, Marutam, Neytal].<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8028src" href="#xd21e8028" name="xd21e8028src">2</a>
The class consists of several clans, but they may be broadly divided
into two sections, the one more thoroughly organised, the other
retaining most of the essential characteristics of an aboriginal race.
The first section follow the Vaishnava sect, wear the n&#257;mam, and
call themselves Y&#257;davas. Those belonging to the second section
stick to their demon worship, and make no pretensions to a descent from
the Y&#257;dava race. They daub their foreheads with the sacred
cow-dung ashes, and are regarded, apparently from this circumstance
alone, to belong to the Saiva sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1871, it is noted that milkmen and
cowherds appear to hold a social position of some importance, and even
Br&#257;hmans do not disdain to drink milk or curds from their hands.
Further, the Census Superintendent, 1901, writes that &ldquo;the
Idaiyans take a higher social position than they would otherwise do,
owing to the tradition that Krishna was brought up by their caste, and
to the fact that they are the only purveyors of milk, gh&#299;
(clarified butter), etc., and so are indispensable to the community.
All Br&#257;hmans, except the most orthodox, will accordingly eat
butter-milk and butter brought by them. In some places they have the
privilege of breaking the butter-pot on the G&#333;kul&#257;shtami, or
Krishna&rsquo;s birthday, and get a new cloth and some money for doing
it. They will eat in the houses of Vell&#257;las, Pallis, and
Nattam&#257;ns.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href=
"#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Idaiyans claim that Timma R&#257;ja, the prime minister of
Krishna D&#275;va R&#257;ya of Vijayanagar, who executed various works
in the Chingleput district, was an Idaiyan by caste.</p>
<p>The Idaiyans have returned a large number of divisions, of which the
following may be noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>Kalkatti and P&#257;si. The women, contrary to the usual Tamil
custom, have black beads in their t&#257;li-string. The practice is
apparently due to the influence of Telugu Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hits,
as various Telugu castes have glass beads along with the bottu
(marriage badge). In like manner, the married Pandamutti Palli women
wear a necklace of black beads. According to a legend, p&#257;si is a
pebble found in rivers, from which beads are made. A giant came to kill
Krishna when he was playing with the shepherd boys on the banks of a
river. He fought the giant with these pebbles, and killed him.</p>
<p>P&#257;l, milk. Corresponds to the H&#257;lu (milk) division of the
Canarese Kuruba shepherd caste.</p>
<p>Pendukkumekki, denoting those who are subservient to their women. A
man, on marriage, joins his wife&rsquo;s family, and he succeeds to the
property, not of his father, but of his father-in-law.</p>
<p>Siviyan or Siv&#257;la. An occupational name, meaning
palanquin-bearer.</p>
<p>Sangukatti, or those who tie the conch or chank shell (<i>Turbinella
rapa</i>). It is narrated that Krishna wanted to marry Rukmani, whose
family insisted on marrying her to Sishup&#257;lan. When the wedding
was about to take place, Krishna carried off Rukmani, and placed a
bangle made of chank shell on her wrist.</p>
<p>S&#257;mb&#257;n, a name of Siva. Most members of this division put
on the sacred ashes as a sectarian mark. It is said that the
Y&#257;davas were in the habit of making <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>offerings to
D&#275;v&#275;ndra, but Krishna wanted them to worship him. With the
exception of a few Y&#257;davas and Paraiyans who were also employed in
grazing cattle, all the shepherds refused to do so. It is stated that
&ldquo;in ancient times, men of the Idaiyan caste ranked only a little
above Paraiyans, and that the Idaich&#275;ri, or Idaiyan suburb, was
always situated close to the Paraich&#275;ri, or Paraiyan&rsquo;s
suburb, in every properly constituted village.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8056src" href="#xd21e8056" name="xd21e8056src">3</a></p>
<p>Pudun&#257;ttu or Puthukkan&#257;ttar, meaning people of the new
country. The Idaiyans claim that, when Krishna settled in Kishkindha,
he peopled it with members of their caste.</p>
<p>Per&#363;n (big) T&#257;li, and Siru (small) T&#257;li, indicating
those whose married women wear a large or small t&#257;li.</p>
<p>Panj&#257;ram or Panch&#257;ramkatti. The name is derived from the
peculiar gold ornament called panj&#257;ram or panch&#257;ram shaped
like a many-rayed sun, and having three dots on it, which is worn by
widows. It is said that in this division &ldquo;widow marriage is
commonly practiced, because Krishna used to place a similar ornament
round the necks of the Idaiyan widows of whom he became enamoured, to
transform them from widows into married women, to whom pleasure was not
forbidden, and that this sub-division is the result of these
amours.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8065src" href="#xd21e8065"
name="xd21e8065src">4</a></p>
<p>Maniyakk&#257;ra. Derived from mani, a bell, such as is tied round
the necks of cattle, sheep and goats.</p>
<p>Kalla. Most numerous in the area inhabited by the Kallan caste.
Possibly an offshoot of this caste, composed of those who have taken to
the occupation of shepherds. Like the Kallans, this sub-division has
exogamous septs or k&#299;lais, <i>e.g.</i>, D&#275;va (god),
V&#275;ndhan (king). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356"
name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sh&#333;lia. Territorial name denoting inhabitants of the Ch&#333;la
country.</p>
<p>&#256;naikombu, or elephant tusk, which was the weapon used by
Krishna and the Y&#257;davas to kill the giant Sakatasura.</p>
<p>Karutthak&#257;du, black cotton country. A sub-division found mostly
in Madura and Tinnevelly, where there is a considerable tract of black
cotton soil.</p>
<p>The Perum&#257;l M&#257;dukk&#257;rans or Perum&#257;l
Erudukk&#257;rans (<i>see</i> Gangeddu), who travel about the country
exhibiting performing bulls, are said to belong to the P&#363; (flower)
Idaiyan section of the Idaiyan caste. This is so named because the
primary occupation thereof was, and in some places still is, making
garlands for temples.</p>
<p>In the Gazetteer of the Madura district, it is recorded that
&ldquo;Podun&#257;ttu (Pudun&#257;ttu?) Idaiyans have a tradition that
they originally belonged to Tinnevelly, but fled to this district
secretly one night in a body in the time of Tirumala N&#257;yakkan,
because the local chief oppressed them. Tirumala welcomed them, and put
them under the care of the Kallan headman Pinnai D&#275;van, decreeing
that, to ensure that this gentleman and his successors faithfully
observed the charge, they should always be appointed by an Idaiyan.
That condition is observed to this day. In this sub-division a man has
the same right to marry his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter as is
possessed by the Kallans. But, if the woman&rsquo;s age is much greater
than the boy&rsquo;s, she is usually married instead to his cousin, or
some one else on that side of the family. A Br&#257;hman officiates at
weddings, and the sacred fire is used, but the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister ties the t&#257;li (marriage badge). Divorce and the remarriage
of widows are prohibited. The dead, except infants, are burnt. Caste
affairs are settled by a headman called the
N&#257;tt&#257;nmaik&#257;ran, who is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>assisted by an
accountant and a peon. All three are elected. The headman has the
management of the caste fund, which is utilised in the celebration of
festivals on certain days in some of the larger temples of the
district. Among these Podun&#257;ttus, an uncommon rule of inheritance
is in force. A woman who has no male issue at the time of her
husband&rsquo;s death has to return his property to his brother,
father, or maternal uncle, but is allotted maintenance, the amount of
which is fixed by a caste panch&#257;yat (council). Among the Valasu
and Pendukkumekki sub-divisions, another odd form of maintenance
subsists. A man&rsquo;s property descends to his sons-in-law, who live
with him, and not to his sons. The sons merely get maintenance until
they are married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, P&#333;ndan or P&#333;gandan is
recorded as a sub-caste of Idaiyans, who are palanquin-bearers to the
Zamorin of Calicut. In this connection, it is noted by Mr. K. Kannan
N&#257;yar<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8094src" href="#xd21e8094" name=
"xd21e8094src">5</a> that &ldquo;among the Konar (cowherds) of
Poondurai near Erode (in the Coimbatore district), who, according to
tradition, originally belonged to the same tribe as the Gopas living in
the southern part of K&#275;rala, and now forming a section of the
N&#257;yars, the former matrimonial customs were exactly the same as
those of the N&#257;yars. They, too, celebrated t&#257;li-kettu
kaly&#257;nam, and, like the N&#257;yars, did not make it binding on
the bride and bridegroom of the ceremony to live as husband and wife.
They have now, however, abandoned the custom, and have made the tying
of the t&#257;li the actual marriage ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The typical panch&#257;yat (village council) system exists among the
Idaiyans, and the only distinguishing feature is the existence of a
headman, called K&#299;th&#257;ri or K&#299;l&#257;ri, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>whose business it is to look after the sheep of
the village, to arrange for penning them in the fields. In some places
the headman is called Ambalakk&#257;ran. In bygone days, those who were
convicted of adultery were tied to a post, and beaten.</p>
<p>In some places, when a girl reaches puberty, her maternal uncle, or
his sons, build a hut with green cocoanut leaves, which she occupies
for sixteen days, when purificatory ceremonies are performed.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremonies vary according to locality, and the
following details of one form therefore, as carried out at Coimbatore,
may be cited. When a marriage between two persons is contemplated, a
red and white flower, tied up in separate betel leaves, are thrown
before the idol at a temple. A little child is told to pick up one of
the leaves, and, if she selects the one containing the white flower,
the omens are considered auspicious, and the marriage will be arranged.
On the day of the betrothal, the future bridegroom&rsquo;s father and
other relations go to the girl&rsquo;s house with presents of a new
cloth, fruits, and ornaments. The bride price (pariyam) is paid, and
betel exchanged. The bridegroom-elect goes to the girl&rsquo;s cousins
(maternal uncle&rsquo;s sons), who have a right to marry her, and
presents them with four annas and betel. The acceptance of these is a
sign that they consent to the marriage. On the marriage day, the
bridegroom plants the milk-post, after it has been blessed by a
Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit, and is shaved by a barber. The bride and her
female relations fetch some earth, and a platform is made out of it in
the marriage pandal (booth). The Br&#257;hman makes fire (h&#333;mam),
and places a cowdung Pillayar (Gan&#275;sa) in the pandal. The bride
then husks some rice therein. The relations of the bride and bridegroom
fetch from the potter&rsquo;s house seven pots called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>adukup&#257;nai, two large pots, called
aras&#257;nip&#257;nai, and seven earthen trays, and place them in
front of the platform. The pots are filled with water, and a small bit
of gold is placed in each. The bridegroom goes to a Pillayar shrine,
and, on his return, the bride&rsquo;s brother washes his feet, and puts
rings on his second toes. The kankanams (wrist-threads) are tied on the
wrists of the contracting couple, and the bridegroom takes his seat
within the pandal, to which the bride is carried in the arms of one of
her maternal uncles, while another carries a torch light placed on a
mortar. The bride takes her seat by the side of the bridegroom, and the
light is set in front of them. The t&#257;li is taken round to be
blessed by those assembled, and handed to the bridegroom, who ties it
on the bride&rsquo;s neck. The couple then put a little earth in each
of the seven trays, and sow therein nine kinds of grain. Two vessels,
containing milk and whey, are placed before them, and the relations
pour a little thereof over their heads. The right hand of the
bridegroom is placed on the left hand of the bride, and their hands are
tied together by one of the bride&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s sons.
The bride is then carried into the house in the arms of an elder
brother of the bridegroom. At the threshold she is stopped by the
maternal uncle&rsquo;s sons, who may beat the man who is carrying her.
The bridegroom pays them each four annas, and he and the bride are
allowed to enter the house. On the night of the wedding day, they are
shut up in a room. During the following days the pots are worshipped.
On the seventh day, the ends of the cloths of the newly married couple
are tied together, and they bathe in turmeric water. The wrist-threads
are removed, they rub oil over each other&rsquo;s heads, and bathe in a
tank. The bride serves food to the bridegroom, and their relations eat
off the same leaf, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360"
name="pb360">360</a>]</span>to indicate the union between the two
families. Into one of the large pots a gold and silver ring, and into
the other an iron style and piece of palm leaf are dropped. The couple
perform the pot-searching ceremony, and whichever gets hold of the gold
ring or style is regarded as the more clever of the two. The bridegroom
places his right foot, and the bride her left foot on a grindstone, and
they look at the star Arundathi. The stone represents Ahalliya, the
wife of the sage Gautama, who was cursed by her husband for her
misconduct with Indra, and turned into a stone, whereas Arundathi was
the wife of Vasishta and a model of chastity. The newly married couple,
by placing their feet on the stone, indicate their intention of
checking unchaste desires, and by looking at Arundathi, of remaining
faithful to each other. The bride decorates a small grindstone with a
cloth and ornaments, and takes it round to all her relations who are
present, and who bless her with a hope that she will have many
children.</p>
<p>In the Marava country, a grown-up Idaiyan girl is sometimes married
to a boy of ten or twelve. Among some Idaiyans, it is customary for the
t&#257;li to be tied by the sister of the bridegroom, and not by the
bridegroom, who must not be present when it is done.</p>
<p>It is said that, in some places, like the Gollas, when an Idaiyan
bridegroom sets out for the house of his bride, he is seized by his
companions, who will not release him till he has paid a piece of gold.
In the Madura Manual it is noted that &ldquo;at an Idaiyan wedding, on
the third day, when the favourite amusement of sprinkling
turmeric-water over the guests is concluded, the whole party betake
themselves to the village tank (pond). A friend of the bridegroom
brings a hoe and a basket, and the young husband fills three baskets
with earth from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361"
name="pb361">361</a>]</span>bottom of the tank, while the wife takes
them away, and throws the earth behind. They then say &lsquo;We have
dug a ditch for charity.&rsquo; This practice may probably be explained
by remembering that, in arid districts, where the Idaiyans often tend
their cattle, the tank is of the greatest importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that the Siviyan and Pendukkumekki sub-divisions take low
rank, as the remarriage of widows is freely permitted among them. In
the Ramn&#257;d territory of the Madura district, the marriage of
widows is attributed to compulsion by a Zamindar. According to the
story, the Zamindar asked an Idaiyan whether he would marry a widow.
The reply was that widows are aruthukatt&#257;dhavar, <i>i.e.</i>,
women who will not tie the t&#257;li string again, after snapping it
(on the husband&rsquo;s decease). This was considered impertinent by
the Zamindar, as marriage of widows was common among the Maravars. To
compel the Idaiyans to resort to widow marriage, he took advantage of
the ambiguity of the word aruthukatt&#257;dhavar, which would also mean
those who do not tie up in a bundle after cutting or reaping. At the
time of the harvest season, the Zamindar sent his servants to the
Idaiyans with orders that they were not to tie up the rice plants in
sheaves. This led to severe monetary loss, and the Idaiyans consented
reluctantly to widow remarriage.</p>
<p>On the death of a married Idaiyan, at Coimbatore, the corpse is
placed in a seated posture. A measure of rice, a lighted lamp, and a
cocoanut are placed near it, and burning fire-wood is laid at the door
of the house. When the relations and friends have arrived, the body is
removed from the house, and placed in a pandal, supported behind by a
mortar. The male relations put on the sacred thread, and each brings a
pot of water from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362"
name="pb362">362</a>]</span>a tank. The widow rubs oil over the head of
the corpse, and some one, placing a little oil in the hands thereof,
rubs it over her head. On the way to the burning-ground, a barber
carries a fire-brand and a pot, and a washerman carries the mat,
cloths, and other articles used by the deceased. When the iduk&#257;du,
a spot made to represent the shrine of Arichandra who is in charge of
the burial or burning ground, is reached, the polluted articles are
thrown away, and the bier is placed on the ground. A Paraiyan makes a
cross-mark at the four corners of the bier, and the son, who is chief
mourner, places a small coin on three of the marks, leaving out the one
at the north-east corner. The Paraiyan takes these coins and tears a
bit of cloth from the winding-sheet, which is sent to the widow. At the
burning-ground, the relations place rice, water, and small coins in the
mouth of the corpse. The coins are the perquisite of the Paraiyan. The
son, who is clean-shaved, carries a pot of water on his shoulder thrice
round the pyre, and, at each turn, the barber makes a hole in it with a
chank shell, when the head is reached. Finally the pot is broken near
the head. The sacred threads are thrown by those who wear them on the
pyre, and the son sets fire to it, and goes away without looking back.
The widow meanwhile has broken her t&#257;li string, and thrown it into
a vessel of milk, which is set on the spot where the deceased breathed
his last. The son, on his return home after bathing, steps across a
pestle placed at the threshold. &#256;rathi (wave offering) is
performed, and he worships a lighted lamp within the house. On the
following day, rice and <i>Sesbania grandiflora</i> are cooked, and
served to the relatives by the widow&rsquo;s brothers. Next day, milk,
gh&#299; (clarified butter), curds, tender cocoanuts, nine kinds of
grain, water, and other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href=
"#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>articles required for worship, are
taken to the burning-ground. The smouldering ashes are extinguished
with water, and the fragments of the bones are collected, and placed on
a leaf. A miniature plough is made, and the spot on which the body was
burned is ploughed, and the nine kinds of grain are sown. On his return
home, a turban is placed on the head of the son who acted as chief
mourner by his maternal uncles. A new cloth is folded, and on it a
betel leaf is placed, which is worshipped for sixteen days. On the
sixteenth day, a Br&#257;hman makes a human figure with holy grass,
which has to be worshipped by the chief mourner not less than
twenty-five times, and he must bathe between each act of worship. The
bones are then carried in a new earthen pot, and floated on a stream.
At night, food is cooked, and, with a new cloth, worshipped. Rice is
cooked at the door. A cock is tied to a sacrificial post, called
kazhukumaram, set up outside the house, to which the rice is offered.
One end of a thread is tied to the post, and the other end to a new
cloth, which is worshipped inside the house. The thread is watched till
it shakes, and then broken. The door is closed, and the cock is stuck
on the pointed tip of the post, and killed. An empty car is carried in
procession through the streets, and alms are given to beggars. A widow
should remain g&#333;sha (in seclusion) for twelve months after her
husband&rsquo;s death. When a grown-up, but unmarried male or female
dies, a human figure, made out of holy grass, is married to the corpse,
and some of the marriage rites are performed.</p>
<p>The Idaiyans are Vaishnavites, and the more civilised among them are
branded like Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans. Saturday is considered a holy
day. Their most important festival is Krishna Jayanti, or Sr&#299;
Jayanti, in honour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364"
name="pb364">364</a>]</span>of Krishna&rsquo;s birthday. They show
special reverence for the vessels used in dairy operations.</p>
<p>The proverb that the sense of an Idaiyan is on the back of his neck,
for it was there that he received the blows, refers to &ldquo;the story
of the shepherd entering the gate of his house with a crook placed
horizontally on his shoulders, and finding himself unable to get in,
and his being made able to do so by a couple of blows on his back, and
the removal of the crook at the same time. Another proverb is that
there is neither an &#256;ndi among Idaiyans, nor a T&#257;dan among
the potters. The &#256;ndi is always a Saivite beggar, and, the
Idaiyans being always Vaishnavites, they can never have in their midst
a beggar of the Saivite sect, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Being
extremely stupid, whenever any dispute arises among them, they can
never come to any definite settlement, or, as the proverb says, the
disputes between Idaiyans are never easily settled. Keeping and rearing
cattle, grazing and milking them, and living thereby, are their
allotted task in life, and so they are never good agriculturists. This
defect is alluded to in the proverb that the field watered by the
Idaiyan, or by a member of the Palli caste, must ever remain a
waste.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8139src" href="#xd21e8139"
name="xd21e8139src">6</a></p>
<p>Other proverbs, quoted by the Rev. H. Jensen,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8144src" href="#xd21e8144" name="xd21e8144src">7</a> are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The shepherd can get some fool to serve him.</p>
<p>Like a shepherd who would not give anything, but showed an ewe big
with young.</p>
<p>The shepherd destroyed half, and the fool half.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1904, an elementary school for Idaiyans, called the Y&#257;dava
school, was established at Madura. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365"
href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>The usual title of the Idaiyans is K&#333;n&#257;n or K&#333;n
meaning King, but, in the Census Report, 1901, the titles Pillai and
Kariy&#257;lan are also recorded. In the Census Report, 1891, Idaiya is
given as a sub-division of Vakkaiga; and, in the Salem Manual, Idaiyan
appears as a synonym of Sh&#257;n&#257;n.</p>
<p>For the following note on the Idaiyans who have settled in
Travancore, I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. They consist of
two well-defined sections, namely, the Tamil-speaking Idaiyans, who are
but recent immigrants, and largely found in Tevala, Agastisvaram and
Shenkotta, and the Malay&#257;lam-speaking branch, who are early
settlers residing chiefly in Kartikapalli and other taluks of Central
Travancore. The Idaiyans are not largely found in Travancore, because a
branch of the indigenous S&#363;dra community, the Idach&#275;ri
N&#257;yars, are engaged in the same occupation. They are divided into
two classes, viz., Kangayan (shepherds) and Puvandans, who neither
interdine nor intermarry. The latter appear to be divided into four
classes, P&#257;si, Gop&#257;lan, Nambi, and Valayitayan. Puvandan is
another form of the word P&#333;ndan, which means a palanquin-bearer.
It is well known that, in the Tamil country, this was one of the duties
of the Idaiyans, as is evident from a sub-division called Sivi or
Siviyar (palanquin) existing among them. In the early settlement
records of Travancore, they are referred to as Sibis. Many fancy,
though incorrectly, that the word means one who collects flowers. As
the Sibis were experts in palanquin-bearing, they must have been
brought from the Tamil country to serve the medi&aelig;val R&#257;jas.
At the present day, besides pursuing their traditional occupation, they
also engage in agriculture and trade. The position of the Puvandans in
society is not low. They are entitled to the services of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>the
Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s washerman and barber, and they may enter temples,
and advance as far as the place to which N&#257;yars go, except in some
parts of Central Travancore. They are flesh-eaters, and the drinking of
intoxicating liquor is not prohibited. On ceremonial occasions, women
wear the Tamil Idaiya dress, while at other times they adopt the attire
of N&#257;yar women. Their ornaments are foreign, and clearly indicate
that they are a Tamil caste. The marriage badge is called sankhu
t&#257;li, and a small conch-shaped ornament forms its most conspicuous
feature. Besides the ordinary Hindu deities, they worship M&#257;tam,
Yakshi, and Maruta. At weddings, the Idaiyan bridegroom holds a sword
in his left hand, while he takes hold of the bride by the right hand.
Funeral ceremonies are supervised by a barber, who officiates as
priest. Corpses are either burnt or buried. Though they appear to
observe only eleven days&rsquo; death pollution, they cannot enter a
temple until the expiry of sixteen days. An anniversary ceremony in
memory of the deceased is performed on the new-moon day in the month of
Kark&#257;takam (July-August), and, on this day, most members of the
caste go to Varkalai to perform the rite. Many purely Tamil names are
still preserved in the caste, such as Tambi, Ch&#257;mi, Bhagavati, and
Ch&#257;ttu.</p>
<p><b>Idakottu</b> (those who break).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Odd&#275;s, who, during their work as navvies, break stones.</p>
<p><b>Idangai</b> (left-hand).&mdash;Recorded, at times of census, as a
division of <span class="corr" id="xd21e8172" title=
"Source: D&#275;vad&#257;sis">D&#275;va-d&#257;sis</span>, who do
service for castes belonging to the left-hand section.</p>
<p><b>&#298;diga.</b>&mdash;The Telugu toddy-drawers, whose hereditary
occupation is the extraction of the juice of the date and palmyra
palms, go by different names in different localities. Those, for
example, who live in the Salem, North Arcot and Chingleput districts,
are called &#298;digas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href=
"#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>or Indras. In the Northern Circars
and the Nellore district, they are known as Gamallas or Gamandlas, and
in the Cuddapah district as Asilis.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the North Arcot Manual, that &ldquo;&#298;diga is
one of the toddy-drawing castes of the Telugu country, the name being
derived from Telugu &#299;dchu, to draw. The &#298;digas are supposed
to be a branch of the Balija tribe, separated on account of their
occupation. They are chiefly Vaishnavites, having S&#257;t&#257;nis as
their priests. They are divided into two classes, the Dandu
(army)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8183src" href="#xd21e8183" name=
"xd21e8183src">8</a> &#298;digas and the Balija &#298;digas, of whom
the former used originally to distil arrack, but, now that the
manufacture is a monopoly, they usually sell it. The Balija &#298;digas
extract toddy, the juice of the palm tree. They differ from the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns in some of their professional customs, for, while the
Tamilians in climbing tie their knives behind them, the Telugus tie
them on the right thigh. Tamilian drawers extract the juice from
palmyras and cocoanuts, but rarely from the date, and the Telugus from
the palmyras and dates, but never from cocoanuts. The chief object of
their worship is Yellamma, the deity who presides over toddy and
liquor. On every Sunday, the pots containing liquor are decorated with
flowers, saffron, etc., and offerings are made to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, it is stated that &ldquo;it is
said that the &#298;digas are the descendants of Balijas from
Rajahmundry in God&#257;vari district, and that their occupation
separated them into a distinct caste. They are divided into two
endogamous sections called either Dandu and Palli, or P&#257;tha (old)
and Kotta (new). The headman of the caste is called Gaudu. They employ
Br&#257;hmans as pur&#333;hits for their ceremonies, and these
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans are received on terms of equality
by other Br&#257;hmans. They bury their dead, and observe pollution for
twelve days, during which they abstain from eating flesh. The
consumption of alcohol is strictly prohibited, and is severely punished
by the headman of the caste. They eat with all Balijas, except the
G&#257;zulu section. Their titles are Aiya, Appa, and Gaudu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. F. Fawcett that &ldquo;in the northern districts,
among the Telugu population, the toddy-drawers use a ladder about eight
or nine feet in length, which is placed against the tree, to avoid
climbing a third or fourth of it. While in the act of climbing up or
down, they make use of a wide band, which is passed round the body at
the small of the back, and round the tree. This band is easily fastened
with a toggle and eye. The back is protected by a piece of thick soft
leather. It gives great assistance in climbing, which it makes easy.
All over the southernmost portion of the peninsula, among the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns and Tiyans, the ladder and waist-band are unknown.
They climb up and down with their hands and arms, using only a soft
grummel of coir (cocoanut fibre) to keep the feet near
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &#298;digas claim to be descended from Vy&#257;sa, the
traditional compiler of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. In a note by Mr. F.
R. Hemingway on the &#298;digas of the God&#257;vari district, they are
said to worship a deity, to whom they annually offer fowls on New
Year&rsquo;s day, and make daily offerings of a few drops of toddy from
the first pot taken from the tree. In this district they are commonly
called Chetti.</p>
<p>The insigne of the &#298;digas, as recorded at Conjeeveram, is a
ladder.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8197src" href="#xd21e8197" name=

<p><b>Idiya</b> (pounder).&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census
Report, 1901, as a division of Konkani S&#363;dras. The Idiyans prepare
rice in a special manner. Paddy is soaked in water, and roasted over a
fire. While hot, it is placed in a mortar, and pounded with a pestle.
This rice is called avil, which is said to be largely used as a
delicacy in Travancore, and to be employed in certain religious
ceremonies.</p>
<p>The Idiyans are stated to have left their native land near Cochin,
and settled in Travancore at the invitation of a former sovereign. On
arrival in the land of their adoption, they were given, free of tax,
cocoanut gardens and rice land. In return, they were required to
supply, free of charge, the palace of the Mah&#257;r&#257;jah and the
temple of Sri Padmanabhasw&#257;mi at Trivandrum with as much beaten
rice (avil) as might be required from time to time.</p>
<p><b>&#298;ga</b> (fly).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Mutr&#257;cha. The
equivalent &#298;gala occurs as an exogamous sept of
Y&#257;n&#257;di.</p>
<p><b>Ilai</b> (leaf).&mdash;Ilai or Ele has been recorded as a
sub-division of Tigalas and Toreyas who cultivate the betel vine
(<i>Piper betle</i>). Elai V&#257;niyan occurs as a synonym of
Senaikkudaiyans, who are betel leaf sellers in Tinnevelly.</p>
<p><b>Ilaiy&#257;ttakudi.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of
N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chetti.</p>
<p><b>Ilakutiyan.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, as a sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Ilamagan.</b>&mdash;The Ilamagans are described by Mr.
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8230src" href="#xd21e8230" name=
"xd21e8230src">10</a> as &ldquo;a cultivating caste found chiefly in
the Zamindari taluk of Tiruppatt&#363;r in Madura. The word literally
means a young man, but the young is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>interpreted by other
castes in the sense of inferior. One says that it is made up of the
sons of Vallamban females and Vell&#257;la males, another that it is a
mixture of outcasted Valaiyans, Kallans and Maravans, and a third that
it is descended from illegitimate children of the Vell&#257;las and
Pallis. Like the Kallans and Valaiyans, the members of the caste
stretch the lobes of their ears, and leave their heads unshaven. The
caste is divided into two or three endogamous sections of territorial
origin. They do not employ Br&#257;hmans as pur&#333;hits; their widows
may marry again; their dead are usually buried; and they will eat pork,
mutton, fowls, and fish. They are thus not high in the social scale,
and are, in fact, about on a par with the Kallans. The headmen of the
caste are called Ambalam.&rdquo; It is suggested, in the Census Report,
1891, that, from the fact that Ilamagan appears as a sub-division of
the Maravans, it may perhaps be inferred that the two castes are
closely allied.</p>
<p><b>Ilampi.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, as a sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Ilayatu.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Elayad.</p>
<p><b>Illa</b> (of a house).&mdash;An exogamous sept of

the house of an ordinary Namb&#363;dri Br&#257;hman. It is recorded, in
the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as a sub-division of N&#257;yar.
The name Illam Vell&#257;la has been assumed by some Panikkans in the
Tamil country, whose exogamous septs are called Illam. In Travancore,
Ilakkar or Illathu, meaning those attached to Br&#257;hman houses, is
said to be an occupational sub-division of N&#257;yars. Ilakkar further
occurs as an exogamous sept of Mala Arayans, known as the Three

<p><b>Ir&#257;ni.</b>&mdash;A territorial name, meaning Persian, of the

Beluchis are described by Mr. Paupa Rao Naidu<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8317src" href="#xd21e8317" name="xd21e8317src">12</a> as a
troublesome nomad tribe &ldquo;committing crime all over India openly
from the houses and shops of villages and towns, mostly in broad
daylight, with impunity, and escaping punishment except in rare cases.
Their ostensible profession is merchandise, dealing in the following
articles:&mdash;ponies, knives, scissors, padlocks, false stones, false
pearls, trinkets of several kinds, toys, beads, quicksilver, and false
coins of different kinds. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href=
"#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their camp generally consists of a few small tents, a few ponies,
pack saddles to secure their culinary utensils, their dirty clothes,
the leather or gunny bags containing their articles of merchandise; a
few fighting cocks, and cages of birds. They are very fond of cock
fighting, even on wagers of 10 to 50 rupees on each. They train these
cocks specially brought up to fight.&rdquo; For information concerning
the criminal methods of the Ir&#257;nis, I would refer the reader to
Mr. Paupa Rao Naidu&rsquo;s account thereof.</p>
<p><b>Iranyavarma.</b>&mdash;The name of one of the early Pallava

<p><b>Irpina</b> (comb).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kamma.</p>
<p><b>Irulas</b> of the N&#299;lgiris. In the Kotagiri bazaar, which is
an excellent hunting-ground for the anthropologist, may be seen
gathered together on market-day Kotas, Badagas, Kanarese, Irulas,
Kurumbas, and an occasional Toda from the Kodan&#257;d mand. A tribal
photograph was taken there, with the result that a deputation
subsequently waited on me with a petition to the effect that &ldquo;We,
the undersigned, beg to submit that your honour made <span class="corr"
id="xd21e8351" title="Source: botos">photos</span> of us, and has paid
us nothing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>We, therefore, beg you to do this common act of
justice.&rdquo; The deputation was made happy with a
<i>pourboire</i>.</p>
<p>In my hunt after Irulas, which ended in an attack of malarial fever,
it was necessary to invoke the assistance and proverbial hospitality of
various planters. On one occasion news reached me that a gang of
Irulas, collected for my benefit under a promise of substantial
remuneration, had arrived at a planter&rsquo;s bungalow, whither I
proceeded. The party included a man who had been &ldquo;wanted&rdquo;
for some time in connection with the shooting of an elephant on
forbidden ground. He, suspecting me of base designs, refused to be
measured, on the plea that he was afraid the height-measuring standard
was the gallows. Nor would he let me take his photograph, fearing
(though he had never heard of Bertillonage) lest it should be used for
the purpose of criminal identification. Unhappily a mischievous rumour
had been circulated that I had in my train a wizard Kurumba, who would
bewitch the Irulas, in order that I might abduct them (for what purpose
was not stated).</p>
<p>As the Badagas are the fairest, so the Irulas are the
darkest-skinned of the N&#299;lgiri tribes, on some of whom, as has
been said, charcoal would leave a white mark. The name Irula, in fact,
means darkness or blackness (irul), whether in reference to the dark
jungles in which the Irulas, who have not become domesticated by
working as contractors or coolies on planters&rsquo; estates, dwell, or
to the darkness of their skin, is doubtful. Though the typical Irula is
dark-skinned and platyrhine, I have noted some who, as the result of
contact metamorphosis, possessed skins of markedly paler hue, and
leptorhine noses.</p>
<p>The language of the Irulas is a corrupt form of Tamil. In their
religion they are worshippers of Vishnu under the name of
Rangasv&#257;mi, to whom they do p&#363;ja <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>(worship) at their own rude shrines, or at the
Hindu temple at Karaimadai, where Br&#257;hman priests officiate.
&ldquo;An Irula p&#363;j&#257;ri,&rdquo; Breeks writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8368src" href="#xd21e8368" name=
"xd21e8368src">13</a> &ldquo;lives near the Irula temples, and rings a
bell when he performs p&#363;ja to the gods. He wears the Vishnu mark
on his forehead. His office is hereditary, and he is remunerated by
offerings of fruit and milk from Irula worshippers. Each Irula village
pays about two annas to the p&#363;j&#257;ri about May or June. They
say that there is a temple at Kallampalla in the Sattiyamangalam
t&#257;luk, north of Rangasv&#257;mi&rsquo;s peak. This is a Siva
temple, at which sheep are sacrificed. The p&#363;j&#257;ri wears the
Siva mark. They don&rsquo;t know the difference between Siva and
Vishnu. At Kallampalla temple is a thatched building, containing a
stone called M&#257;riamma, the well-known goddess of small-pox,
worshipped in this capacity by the Irulas. A sheep is led to this
temple, and those who offer the sacrifice sprinkle water over it, and
cut its throat. The p&#363;j&#257;ri sits by, but takes no part in the
ceremony. The body is cut up, and distributed among the Irulas present,
including the p&#363;j&#257;ri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the shrine on Rangasv&#257;mi peak, the following
note is recorded in the Gazetteer of the N&#299;lgiris. &ldquo;It is
the most sacred hill on all the plateau. Hindu legend says that the god
Rangasv&#257;mi used to live at Karaimadai on the plains between
Mettup&#257;laiyam and Coimbatore, but quarrelled with his wife, and so
came and lived here alone. In proof of the story, two footprints on the
rock not far from Arak&#333;d village below the peak are pointed out.
This, however, is probably an invention designed to save the hill folk
the toilsome journey to Rangasv&#257;mi&rsquo;s car festival at
Karaimadai, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>which used once to be considered incumbent upon
them. In some places, the Badagas and Kotas have gone even further, and
established Rangasv&#257;mi Bettus of their own, handy for their own
particular villages. On the real Rangasv&#257;mi peak are two rude
walled enclosures sacred to the god Ranga and his consort, and within
these are votive offerings (chiefly iron lamps and the notched sticks
used as weighing machines), and two stones to represent the deities.
The hereditary p&#363;j&#257;ri is an Irula, and, on the day fixed by
the Badagas for the annual feast, he arrives from his hamlet near
Nandipuram, bathes in a pool below the summit, and marches to the top
shouting &lsquo;Govinda! Govinda<span class="corr" id="xd21e8375"
title="Source: &rsquo;!">!&rsquo;</span> The cry is taken up with wild
enthusiasm by all those present, and the whole crowd, which includes
Badagas, Irulas, and Kurumbas, surrounds the enclosures, while the
Irula priest invokes the deities by blowing his conch and beating his
drum, and pours oblations over, and decorates with flowers, the two
stones which represent them. That night, two stone basins on the summit
are filled with ghee and lighted, and the glare is visible for miles
around. The ceremonies close with prayers for good rain and
fruitfulness among the flocks and herds, a wild dance by the Irula, and
the boiling (called pongal, the same word as pongal the Tamil
agricultural feast) of much rice in milk. About a mile from Arak&#333;d
is an overhanging rock called the kodai-kal or umbrella stone, under
which is found a whitish clay. This clay is used by the Irulas for
making the Vaishnava marks on their foreheads at this
festival.&rdquo;</p>

"pb376">376</a>]</span>manner with wreaths of plaited straw. Their
necks, ears, and ankles were decorated with ornaments formed of the
same material, and they carried little dried gourds, in which nuts or
small stones had been inserted. They rattled them as they moved, and,
with the rustling of their rural ornaments, gave a sort of rhythm to
their motion. The dance was performed in front of a little thatched
shed, which, we learnt, was their temple. When it was concluded, they
commenced a sacrifice to their deity, or rather deities, of a he-goat
and three cocks. This was done by cutting the throats of the victims,
and throwing them down at the feet of the idol, the whole assembly at
the same time prostrating themselves. Within the temple there was a
winnow, or fan, which they called Mahri&mdash;evidently the emblem of
Ceres; and at a short distance, in front of the former, and some paces
in advance one of the other, were two rude stones, which they call, the
one Moshani, the other Konadi Mari, but which are subordinate to the
fan occupying the interior of the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A village near a coffee estate, which I inspected, was, at the time
of my visit, in the possession of pariah dogs and nude children, the
elder children and adults being away at work. The village was protected
against nocturnal feline and other feral marauders by a rude fence, and
consisted of rows of single-storied huts, with verandah in front, made
of split bamboo and thatched, detached huts, an abundance of
fowl-houses, and cucurbitaceous plants twining up rough stages.
Surrounding the village were a dense grove of plantain trees,
castor-oil bushes, and cattle pens.</p>
<p>When not engaged at work on estates or in the forest, the Irulas
cultivate, for their own consumption, r&#257;gi (<i>Eleusine
Coracana</i>), s&#257;mai (<i>Panicum miliare</i>), tenai <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>(<i>Setaria italica</i>), tovarai (<i>Cajanus
indicus</i>), maize, plantains, etc. They also cultivate limes,
oranges, jak fruit (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>), etc. They, like
the Kotas, will not attend to cultivation on Saturday or Monday. At the
season of sowing, Badagas bring cocoanuts, plantains, milk and gh&#299;
(clarified butter), and give them to the Irulas, who, after offering
them before their deity, return them to the Badagas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Irulas,&rdquo; a recent writer observes, &ldquo;generally
possess a small plot of ground near their villages, which they
assiduously cultivate with grain, although they depend more upon the
wages earned by working on estates. Some of them are splendid
cattle-men, that is, in looking after the cattle possessed by some
enterprising planter, who would add the sale of dairy produce to the
nowadays pitiable profit of coffee planting. The Irula women are as
useful as the men in weeding, and all estate work. In fact, planters
find both men and women far more industrious and reliable than the
Tamil coolies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the sale of the produce of the forests,&rdquo; Harkness
writes, &ldquo;such as honey and bees wax, or the fruit of their
gardens, the Irulas are enabled to buy grain for their immediate
sustenance, and for seed. But, as they never pay any attention to the
land after it is sown, or indeed to its preparation further than by
partially clearing it of the jungle, and turning it up with the hoe;
or, what is more common, scratching it into furrows with a stick, and
scattering the grain indiscriminately, their crops are, of course,
stunted and meagre. When the corn is ripe, if at any distance from the
village, the family to whom the patch or field belongs will remove to
it, and, constructing temporary dwellings, remain there so long as the
grain lasts. Each morning they pluck as much as they think they may
require for the use of that day, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378"
href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>kindle a fire upon the
nearest large stone or fragment of rock, and, when it is well heated,
brush away the embers, and scatter the grain upon it, which, soon
becoming parched and dry, is readily reduced to meal, which is made
into cakes. The stone is now heated a second time, and the cakes are
put on it to bake. Or, where they have met with a stone which has a
little concavity, they will, after heating it, fill the hollow with
water, and, with the meal, form a sort of porridge. In this way the
whole family, their friends, and neighbours, will live till the grain
has been consumed. The whole period is one of merry-making. They
celebrate Mahri, and invite all who may be passing by to join in the
festivities. These families will, in return, be invited to live on the
fields of their neighbours. Many of them live for the remainder of the
year on a kind of yam, which grows wild, and is called Erula root. To
the use of this they accustom their children from infancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Irulas now work for the Forest Department, which allows them to
live on the borders of the forest, granting them sites free, and other
concessions. Among the minor forest produce, which they collect, are
myrabolams, bees-wax, honey, vembadam bark (<i>Ventilago
Madraspatana</i>), avaram bark (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>), deer&rsquo;s
horns, tamarinds, gum, soapnuts, and sheekoy (<i>Acacia concinna</i>).
The forests have been divided into blocks, and a certain place within
each block has been selected for the forest depot. To this place the
collecting agents&mdash;mostly Sh&#333;lagars and Irulas&mdash;bring
the produce, and then it is sorted, and paid for by special
supervisors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8429src" href="#xd21e8429"
name="xd21e8429src">15</a> The collection of honey is a dangerous
occupation. A man, with a torch in his hand, and a number of bamboo
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>tubes suspended from his shoulders, descends by
means of ropes or creepers to the vicinity of the comb. The sight of
the torch drives away the bees, and he proceeds to fill the bamboos
with the comb, and then ascends to the top of the rock.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8435src" href="#xd21e8435" name=
"xd21e8435src">16</a></p>
<p>The Irulas will not (so they say) eat the flesh of buffaloes or
cattle, but will eat sheep and goat, field-rats, fowls, deer, pig
(which they shoot), hares (which they snare with skilfully made nets),
jungle-fowl, pigeons, and quail (which they knock over with
stones).</p>
<p>They informed Mr. Harkness that, &ldquo;they have no marriage
contract, the sexes cohabiting almost indiscriminately; the option of
remaining in union, or of separating, resting principally with the
female. Some among them, the favourites of fortune, who can afford to
spend four or five rupees on festivities, will celebrate their union by
giving a feast to all their friends and neighbours; and, inviting the
Kurumbars to attend with their pipe and tabor, spend the night in dance
and merriment. This, however, is a rare occurrence.&rdquo; The marriage
ceremony, as described to me, is a very simple affair. A feast is held,
at which a sheep is killed, and the guests make a present of a few
annas to the bridegroom, who ties up the money in a cloth, and, going
to the bride&rsquo;s hut, conducts her to her future home. Widows are
permitted to marry again.</p>
<p>When an Irula dies, two Kurumbas come to the village, and one shaves
the head of the other. The shorn man is fed, and presented with a
cloth, which he wraps round his head. This quaint ceremonial is
supposed, in some way, to bring good luck to the departed. Outside the
house of the deceased, in which the corpse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>is
kept till the time of the funeral, men and women dance to the music of
the Irula band. The dead are buried in a sitting posture, with the legs
crossed tailorwise. Each village has its own burial-ground. A circular
pit is dug, from the lower end of which a chamber is excavated, in
which the corpse, clad in its own clothes, jewelry, and a new cloth, is
placed with a lamp and grain. The pit is then filled in, and the
position of the grave marked by a stone. On the third day a sheep is
said to be killed, and a feast held. The following description of an
annual ceremony was given to me. A lamp and oil are purchased, and rice
is cooked in the village. They are then taken to the shrine at the
burial-ground, offered up on stones, on which some of the oil is
poured, and p&#363;ja is done. At the shrine, a p&#363;j&#257;ri, with
three white marks on the forehead, officiates. Like the Badaga
D&#275;vad&#257;ri, the Irula p&#363;j&#257;ri at times becomes
inspired by the god.</p>
<p>Writing concerning the Kurumbas and Irulas, Mr. Walhouse
says<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8449src" href="#xd21e8449" name=
"xd21e8449src">17</a> that &ldquo;after every death among them, they
bring a long water-worn stone (devva kotta kallu), and put it into one
of the old cromlechs sprinkled over the Nilgiri plateau. Some of the
larger of these have been found piled up to the cap-stone with such
pebbles, which must have been the work of generations. Occasionally,
too, the tribes mentioned make small cromlechs for burial purposes, and
place the long water-worn pebbles in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following sub-divisions of the tribe have been described to
me:&mdash;Poongkaru, Kudagar (people of Coorg), Kalkatti (those who tie
stone), Vellaka, Dev&#257;la, and Koppilingam. Of these, the first five
are considered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>to be in the relation of brothers, so far as
marriage is concerned, and do not intermarry. Members of these five
classes must marry into the Koppilingam sub-division. At the census,
1901, Kasuva or Kasuba was returned as a sub-caste. The word means
workmen, in allusion to the abandonment of jungle life in favour of
working on planters&rsquo; estates, and elsewhere.</p>

</div>
<p>It is recorded by Harkness that &ldquo;during the winter, or while
they are wandering about the forests in search of food, driven by
hunger, the families or parties separate from one another. On these
occasions the women and young children are often left alone, and the
mother, having no longer any nourishment for her infant, anticipates
its final misery by burying it alive. The account here given was in
every instance corroborated, and in such a manner as to leave no doubt
in our minds of its correctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following notes are abstracted from my case-book.</p>
<p>Man, &aelig;t. 30. Sometimes works on a coffee estate. At present
engaged in the cultivation of grains, pumpkins, jak-fruit, and
plantains. Goes to the bazaar at Mettupalaiyam to buy rice, salt,
chillies, oil, etc. Acquires agricultural implements from Kotas, to
whom he pays annual tribute in grains or money. Wears brass earrings
obtained from Kotas in exchange for vegetables and fruit. Wears turban

<p><b>Irulas</b> of Chingleput, North and South Arcot. The Irulas, or
Villiyans (bowmen), who have settled in the town of Chingleput, about
fifty miles distant from Madras, have attained to a higher degree of
civilisation than the jungle Irulas of the N&#299;lgiris, and are
defined, in the Census Report, 1901, as a semi-Br&#257;hmanised forest
tribe, who speak a corrupt Tamil.</p>
<p>In a note on the Irulas, Mackenzie writes as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8486src" href="#xd21e8486" name=
"xd21e8486src">18</a> &ldquo;After the Yuga Pralayam (deluge, or change
from one Yuga to another) the Villars or Irulans, Malayans, and Vedans,
supposed to be descendants of a Rishi under the influence of a
malignant curse, were living in the forests in a state of nature,
though they have now taken to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383"
href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>wearing some kind of
covering&mdash;males putting on skins, and females stitched leaves.
Roots, wild fruits, and honey constitute their dietary, and cooked rice
is always rejected, even when gratuitously offered. They have no clear
ideas about God, though they offer rice (wild variety) to the goddess
Kanniamma. The legend runs that a Rishi, Mala Rishi by name, seeing
that these people were much bothered by wild beasts, took pity on them,
and for a time lived with them. He mixed freely with their women, and
as the result, several children were born, who were also molested by
wild animals. To free them from these, the Rishi advised them to do
p&#363;ja (worship) to Kanniamma. Several other Rishis are also
believed to have lived freely in their midst, and, as a result, several
new castes arose, among which were the Y&#257;n&#257;dis, who have come
into towns, take food from other castes, eat cooked rice, and imitate
the people amidst whom they happen to live.&rdquo; In which respects
the Irula is now following the example of the Y&#257;n&#257;di.</p>
<p>Many of the Chingleput Irulas are very dark-skinned, with narrow
chests, thin bodies, and flabby muscles, reminding me, in their general
aspect, of the Y&#257;n&#257;dis of Nellore. Clothing is, in the men,
reduced to a minimum&mdash;dh&#363;ti, and lang&#363;ti of dirty white
cotton cloth, or a narrow strip of gaudy Manchester piece-good. The
hair is worn long and ragged, or shaved, with kudimi, in imitation of
the higher classes. The moustache is slight, and the beard billy-goaty.
Some of the men are tattooed with a blue dot on the glabella, or
vertical mid-frontal line. For ornaments they have a stick in the
helix, or simple ornament in the ear-lobe.</p>
<p>Their chief source of livelihood is husking paddy (rice), but they
also gather sticks for sale as firewood in return for pice, rice, and
sour fermented rice gruel, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384"
href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>is kept by the higher classes
for cattle. This gruel is also highly appreciated by the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis. While husking rice, they eat the bran, and, if not
carefully watched, will steal as much of the rice as they can manage to
secrete about themselves. As an addition to their plain dietary they
catch field (Jerboa) rats, which they dig out with long sticks, after
they have been asphyxiated with smoke blown into their tunnels through
a small hole in an earthen pot filled with dried leaves, which are set
on fire. When the nest is dug out, they find material for a meat and
vegetable curry in the dead rats, with the hoarded store of rice or
other grain. They feast on the bodies of winged white-ants
(<i>Termites</i>), which they search with torch-lights at the time of
their seasonal epidemic appearance. Some years ago a theft occurred in
my house at night, and it was proved by a plaster cast of a foot-print
in the mud produced by a nocturnal shower that one of my gardeners, who
did not live on the spot, had been on the prowl. The explanation was
that he had been collecting as a food-stuff the carcases of the winged
ants, which had that evening appeared in myriads.</p>
<p>Some Irulas are herbalists, and are believed to have the powers of
curing certain diseases, snake-poisoning, and the bites of rats and
insects.</p>
<p>Occasionally the Irulas collect the leaves of the banyan, <i>Butea
frondosa</i>, or lotus, for sale as food-platters, and they will eat
the refuse food left on the platters by Br&#257;hmans and other higher
classes. They freely enter the houses of Br&#257;hmans and
non-Br&#257;hman castes, and are not considered as carrying
pollution.</p>
<p>They have no fixed place of abode, which they often change. Some
live in low, palmyra-thatched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385"
href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>huts of small dimensions;
others under a tree, in an open place, in ruined buildings, or the
street pials (verandah) of houses. Their domestic utensils consist of a
few pots, one or two winnows, scythes, a crow-bar, a piece of flint and
steel for making fire, and a dirty bag for tobacco and betel. In making
fire, an angular fragment of quartz is held against a small piece of
pith, and dexterously struck with an iron implement so that the spark
falls on the pith, which can be rapidly blown into a blaze. To keep the
children warm in the so-called cold season (with a minimum of 58&deg;
to 60&deg;), they put their babies near the fire in pits dug in the
ground.</p>
<p>For marital purposes they recognise tribal sub-divisions in a very
vague way. Marriage is not a very impressive ceremonial. The bridegroom
has to present new cloths to the bride, and his future father- and
mother-in-law. The cloth given to the last-named is called the p&#257;l
kuli (milk money) for having nursed the bride. Marriage is celebrated
on any day, except Saturday. A very modest banquet, in proportion to
their slender means, is held, and toddy provided, if the state of the
finances will run to it. Towards evening the bride and bridegroom stand
in front of the house, and the latter ties the t&#257;li, which
consists of a bead necklace with a round brass disc. In the case of a
marriage which took place during my visit, the bride had been wearing
her new bridal cloth for a month before the event.</p>
<p>The Irulas worship periodically Kanniamma, their tribal deity, and
M&#257;ri, the general goddess of epidemic disease. The deity is
represented by five pots arranged in the form of a square, with a
single pot in the centre, filled with turmeric water. Close to these a
lamp <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>is lighted, and raw rice, jaggery (crude sugar),
rice flour, betel leaves and areca nuts are offered before it.
M&#257;ri is represented by a white rag flag dyed with turmeric,
hoisted on a bamboo in an open space near their dwellings, to which
fowls, sheep, and other cooked articles, are offered.</p>
<p>The dead are buried lying flat on the face, with the head to the
north, and the face turned towards the east. When the grave has been
half filled in, they throw into it a prickly-pear (<i>Opuntia
Dillenii</i>) shrub, and make a mound over it. Around this they place a
row or two of prickly-pear stems to keep off jackals. No monumental
stone is placed over the grave.</p>
<p>By means of the following table a comparison can be readily made
between the stature and nasal index of the jungle Sh&#333;lagas and
N&#299;lgiri Irulas, and of the more civilised Irulas of Chingleput and
&#362;r&#257;lis of Coimbatore:&mdash;</p>

<p>The table shows clearly that, while all the four tribes are of short
and uniform stature, the nasal index, both as regards average, maximum
and minimum, is higher in the Sh&#333;lagas and Irulas of the
N&#299;lgiri jungles than in the more domesticated Irulas of Chingleput
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>and &#362;r&#257;lis. In brief, the two former,
who have mingled less with the outside world, retain the archaic type
of platyrhine nose to a greater extent than the two latter. The
reduction of platyrhiny, as the result of civilisation and emergence
from the jungle to the vicinity of towns, is still further brought out
by the following figures relating to the two classes of Irulas, and the
K&#257;nikars of Travancore, who still live a jungle life, and those
who have removed to the outskirts of a populous town:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Irulas of North Arcot are closely related to those of
Chingleput. Concerning them, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8643src" href="#xd21e8643" name=
"xd21e8643src">19</a> &ldquo;Many members of this forest tribe have
taken to agriculture in the neighbouring villages, but the majority
still keep to the hills, living upon roots and wild animals, and
bartering forest produce for a few rags or a small quantity of grain.
When opportunity offers, they indulge in cattle theft and robbery. They
disclaim any connection with the Y&#257;n&#257;dis, whom they hate.
Their aversion is such that they will not even allow a Y&#257;n&#257;di
to see them eating. They offer worship to the Sapta Kannikais or seven
virgins, whom they represent in the form of an earthenware <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>oil-lamp, which they often place under the
band&#257;ri (<i>Dodon&oelig;a viscosa ?</i>), which is regarded by
them as sacred. These lamps are made by ordinary village potters, who,
however, are obliged to knead the clay with their hands, and not with
their feet. Sometimes they place these representatives of their goddess
in caves, but, wherever they place them, no Pariah or Y&#257;n&#257;di
can be allowed to approach. The chief occasion of worship, as with the
Kurumbas and Y&#257;n&#257;dis, is at the head-shaving ceremony of
children. All children at these times, who are less than ten years old,
are collected, and the maternal uncle of each cuts off one lock of
hair, which is fastened to a ragi (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) bough. They
rarely contract marriages, the voluntary association of men and women
being terminable at the will of either. The more civilised, however,
imitate the Hindu cultivating castes by tying a gold bead, stuck on a
thread, round the bride&rsquo;s neck, but the marriage tie thus formed
is easily broken. They always bury their dead. Some Irulas are credited
with supernatural powers, and are applied to by low S&#363;dras for
advice. The ceremony is called suthi or rangam. The medium affects to
be possessed by the goddess, and utters unmeaning sounds, being, they
say, unconscious all the while. A few of his companions pretend to
understand with difficulty the meaning of his words, and interpret them
to the inquirer. The Irulas never allow any sort of music during their
ceremonies, nor will they wear shoes, or cover their body with more
than the scantiest rag. Even in the coldest and dampest weather, they
prefer the warmth of a fire to that of a cumbly (blanket). They refuse
even to cover an infant with a cloth, but dig a small hollow in the
ground, and lay the newly-born babe in it upon a few leaves of the
band&#257;ri.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389"
name="pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are two classes of Irulas in the North Arcot district, of
which one lives in towns and villages, and the other leads a jungle
life. Among the latter, as found near Kuppam, there are two distinct
divisions, called &#298;swaran Vagaira and Dharmar&#257;ja. The former
set up a stone beneath a temporary hut, and worship it by offering
cooked rice and cocoanuts on unam (<i>Lettsomia elliptica</i>) leaves.
The god Dharmar&#257;ja is represented by a vessel instead of a stone,
and the offerings are placed in a basket. In the jungle section, a
woman may marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s brother. The dead are
buried face upwards, and three stones are set up over the grave.</p>

<p>The Irulas of South Arcot, Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8667src" href="#xd21e8667" name="xd21e8667src">20</a> &ldquo;are
chiefly found about the Gingee hills, talk a corrupt Tamil, are very
dark skinned, have very curly hair, never shave their heads, and never
wear turbans or sandals. They dwell in scattered huts&mdash;never more
than two or three in one place&mdash;which are little, round, thatched
hovels, with a low doorway through which one can just crawl, built
among the fields. They subsist by watching crops, baling water from
wells, and, when times are hard, by crime of a mild kind. In Villupuram
and Tirukk&#333;yil&#363;r t&#257;luks, and round Gingee, they commit
burglaries in a mild and unscientific manner if the season is bad, and
they are pressed by want, but, if the ground-nut crop is a good one,
they behave themselves. They are perhaps the poorest and most miserable
community in the district. Only one or two of them own any land, and
that is only dry land. They snare hares now and again, and collect the
honey of the wild bees by letting themselves down the face of cliffs at
night by ladders made of twisted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390"
href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>creepers. Some of them are
prostitutes, and used to display their charms in a shameless manner at
the Chettip&#257;laiyam market near Gingee, decked out in quantities of
cheap jewellery, and with their eyelids darkened in clumsy imitation of
their sisters of the same profession in other castes. There is little
ceremony at a wedding. The old men of the caste fix the auspicious day,
the bridegroom brings a few presents, a pandal (booth) is made, a
t&#257;li is tied, and there is a feast to the relations. The rites at
births and deaths are equally simple. The dead are usually buried,
lying face upwards, a stone and some thorns being placed over the grave
to keep off jackals. On the eleventh day after the death, the eldest
son ties a cloth round his head&mdash;a thing which is otherwise never
worn&mdash;and a little rice is coloured with saffron (turmeric) and
then thrown into water. This is called casting away the sin, and
ill-luck would befall the eldest son if the ceremony were omitted. The
Irulans pay homage to almost all the gr&#257;mad&#275;vatas (village
deities), but probably the seven Kannimars are their favourite
deities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As already indicated, the Irulas, like the Yerukalas, indulge in
soothsaying. The Yerukala fortune-teller goes about with her basket,
cowry shells, and rod, and will carry out the work of her profession
anywhere, at any time, and any number of times in a day. The Irula, on
the contrary, remains at his home, and will only tell fortunes close to
his hut, or near the hut where his gods are kept. In case of sickness,
people of all classes come to consult the Irula fortune-teller, whose
occupation is known as Kannimar varniththal. Taking up his drum, he
warms it over the fire, or exposes it to the heat of the sun. When it
is sufficiently dry to vibrate to his satisfaction, Kannimar is
worshipped by breaking a cocoanut, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391"
href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>and burning camphor and
incense. Closing his eyes, the Irula beats the drum, and shakes his
head about, while his wife, who stands near him, sprinkles turmeric
water over him. After a few minutes, bells are tied to his right wrist.
In about a quarter of an hour he begins to shiver, and breaks out in a
profuse perspiration. This is a sure sign that he is possessed by
Kanniamman. His wife unties his kudumi (tuft of hair), the shaking of
the head becomes more violent, he breathes rapidly, and hisses like a
snake. His wife praises Kannimar. Gradually the man becomes calmer, and
addresses those around him as if he were the goddess, saying,
&ldquo;Oh! children. I have come down on my car, which is decorated
with mango flowers, margosa and jasmine. You need fear nothing so long
as I exist, and you worship me. This country will be prosperous, and
the people will continue to be happy. Ere long my precious car,
immersed in the tank (pond) on the hill, will be taken out, and after
that the country will become more prosperous,&rdquo; and so on.
Questions are generally put to the inspired man, not directly, but
through his wife. Occasionally, even when no client has come to consult
him, the Irula will take up his drum towards dusk, and chant the
praises of Kannimar, sometimes for hours at a stretch, with a crowd of
Irulas collected round him.</p>

<p>For the following note on the Izhavas of Travancore, I am, when not
otherwise recorded, indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. These people
are known as Izhavas in South and parts of Central Travancore, and
Chovas in parts of Central and North Travancore. They constitute 17 per
cent. of the total population of the State. Izhava is said to mean
those belonging to Izham, a corruption of Simhalam, one of the old
names of Ceylon. Jaffna, in the north of that island, appears to have
been specially known by the name of Izham, and from this place the
Izhavas are believed to have originally proceeded to Malabar. Chova is
supposed to be a corruption of Sevaka, or servant. In some old boat
songs current in Malabar, it occurs in the less corrupt form of
Chevaka. According to a legend, a P&#257;ndyan princess named Alli
married Narasimha, a R&#257;jah of the Carnatic. The royal couple
migrated to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>Ceylon, and there settled themselves as rulers.
On the line becoming extinct, however, their relatives and adherents
returned to the continent, where they were accorded only a very low
position in society. It is said that they were the ancestors of the
Izhavas. In support of this theory, it is urged that, in South
Travancore, the Izhavas are known by the title of Mudaliyar, which is
also the surname of a division of the Vell&#257;las at Jaffna; that the
Vattis and Mann&#257;ns call them Mudaliyars; and that the Pulayas have
ever been known to address them only as Muttatampur&#257;ns. But it may
be well supposed that the title may have been conferred upon some
families of the caste in consideration of meritorious services on
behalf of the State. One of the chief occupations, in which the Izhavas
first engaged themselves, was undoubtedly the cultivation of palm
trees. In the famous grant of 824 A.D., it is distinctly mentioned that
they had a headman of their guild, and their duty was planting up waste
lands. They had two special privileges, known as the foot-rope right
and ladder right, which clearly explain the nature of their early
occupation. The Syrian Christians appear to have a tradition that the
Izhavas were invited to settle on the west coast at their suggestion.
The Izhavas are said to have brought to K&#275;rala a variety each of
the areca palm, champak, and lime tree, to whose vernacular names the
word Izham is even to-day invariably prefixed. In the middle ages, they
were largely employed as soldiers by the rulers of Malabar. Titles and
privileges were distributed among these soldiers. Canter Visscher,
writing about the R&#257;jah of Ambalapuzha in the middle of the
eighteenth century,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8728src" href=
"#xd21e8728" name="xd21e8728src">22</a> observes that &ldquo;the Rajah
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>Porkkad has not many N&#257;yars, in the place
of whom he is served by Chegos,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;in times of
civil war or rebellion, the Chegos are bound to take up arms for their
lawful sovereign.&rdquo; The Panikkans of Ambanat house in the
Ambalapuzha taluk were the leaders of the Izhava force, and many powers
and privileges were conferred upon this family by the Chembakasseri
(Ambalapuzha) princes. Even so late as the days of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja
R&#257;ma Verma, who died in 973 M.E., large numbers of Izhavas were
employed as soldiers of the State, if we may believe the account of
Friar Bartolomeo,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8733src" href="#xd21e8733"
name="xd21e8733src">23</a> who is generally a very accurate writer. The
South Travancore Izhavas used to divide themselves into two parties on
the occasion of the &#332;nam festival, and fight at Kaithamukku near
Trivandrum. Any young man who did not attend this camp of exercise had
a piece of wood tied as a wedding ornament round his neck, was led in
procession thrice round the village, and transported to the
sea-coast.</p>
<p>The Izhavas proper are divided into three sub-sections called
Pachchili, P&#257;ndi, and Malay&#257;lam. The Pachchilis live in the
tract of land called Pachchal&#363;r in the Neyyattinkara t&#257;luk
between Tiruvellam and Kovalam. They are only a handful in number. The
P&#257;ndis are largely found in Trivandrum and Chirayinkil. Most of
them take the title of Panikkan. The Malay&#257;la Izhavas are
sub-divided into four exogamous groups or illams, named Muttillam,
Madampi or Pallichal, Mayanatti, and Chozhi. Pallichal is a place in
the Neyyattinkara taluk, and Mayannat in Quilon. The members of the
Chozhi illam are believed to have been later settlers. There is another
division of these Izhavas called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395"
href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>Patikramams, based on a more
or less geographical distinction. These are also four in number, and
called Pallikkattara, Palattara, Irunkulamgara, and Tengan&#257;d,
their social precedence being in this order. Pallikkattara is in
Chirayinkil, Palattara in Quilon, Irunkulamgara in Trivandrum, and
Tengan&#257;d in Neyyattinkara. The Palattara section is the most
orthodox, and rigorously preserves its endogamous character, though
some of the titular dignitaries among the Chovas of Central Travancore
have found it possible to contract alliances with them. The divisions
of the Illam and Patikkramam are absent among the Chovas. Among these,
however, there is a division into Sthani or Melkudi, Tanikudi, and
Kizhkudi, the first denoting the titular head, the second the ordinary
class, and the third those under communal degradation. Among the last
are included the toddy-drawing families, Vaduvans, and Nadis. Vaduvans
are the slaves of the Izhavas, and, in ancient days, could be regularly
bought and sold by them. Nadis live in Kartikapalli and some other
parts of Central Travancore. They are people who have been outcasted
from the community for various offences by the headmen, and cannot
enter the kitchen of the ordinary Izhavas. They are served for
ceremonial purposes not by the regular priests of the Izhavas, but by a
distinct outcaste sect like themselves, known as Nadikuruppus. The
Izhavattis, who are the priests of the caste, form a distinct sect with
special manners and customs. Ch&#257;nnan, a corruption of the Tamil
word, Chanror or chiefmen, is the most important of the titles of the
Izhavas. This title was conferred upon distinguished members of the
caste as a family honour by some of the ancient sovereigns of the
country. Panikkan comes next in rank, and is derived from pani, work.
Tantan, from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>danda meaning punishment or control, is a
popular title in some parts. Asan, from Acharya, a teacher, is
extremely common. The recipients of this honour were instructors in
gymnastics and military exercises to N&#257;yar and Izhava soldiers in
bygone times, and even now ruins of old kalaris or exercise grounds
attached to their houses are discernible in many places. Some Izhavas
in South Travancore appear to be honoured with the title of Mudaliyar.
Many families were invested with similar honours by the ancient ruling
houses of Ambalapuzha, Kayenkulam, and Jayasimhanad (Quilon). Even now,
some titles are conferred by the R&#257;jah of Idappalli. The wives of
these dignitaries are respectively known as Ch&#257;nnatti, Panikkatti,
etc.</p>
<p>The houses of the Izhavas resemble those of the N&#257;yars in form.
Each house is a group of buildings, the most substantial of which,
known as the arappura, stands in the centre. On the left side is the
vadakkettu or woman&rsquo;s apartment, including the kitchen. There is
a court-yard in front of the arappura, and a little building called
kizhakkettu enclosing it on the eastern side. Houses invariably face
the east. The main entrance stands a little to the south of the
kizhakkettu, to the south of which again is the tozhuttu or cow-shed.
These buildings, of course, are found only in rich houses, the poor
satisfying themselves with an arappura, a vatakketu, and a tozhuttu. A
tekketu is to be seen to the south of the arappura in some cases. This
is erected mainly to perpetuate the memory of some deceased member of
the family known for learning, piety, or bravery. A p&#299;tha or seat,
a conch, a cane, and a small bag containing ashes, are secured within.
It is kept scrupulously free from pollution, and worship is offered on
fixed days to the ancestors. The tekketu is enclosed on all the three
sides, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>except the east. This description of houses in
South Travancore, as far as Trivandrum, applies also to buildings
erected to the north as far as Quilon, though tekketus are not so
largely found as in the south. In some parts here, the southern room of
the main buildings is consecrated to the memory of ancestors. In
Central Travancore there are big kalaris to the south of the arappura
in most of the ancient houses, and antique weapons and images of
tutelary divinities are carefully preserved therein.</p>
<p>In dress and ornament, the Izhavas closely resemble the N&#257;yars.
The tattu form of dress is not prevalent among Izhava women. In the
wearing of the cloth, the left side comes inside instead of the right
in the case of South Travancore Izhava women, though this rule is not
without its exceptions. In South Travancore, the ornaments of women
differ considerably from those of the north. Here they wear the
pampadam or Tamil S&#363;dra women&rsquo;s ear ornament, and adorn the
wrists with a pair of silver bangles. The nose ornaments m&#363;kkuthi
and gnattu have only recently begun to be worn, and are not very
popular in Central and North Travancore. This is a point in which
Izhavas may be said to differ from the South Travancore N&#257;yar
matrons. The ear ornament of elderly Izhava women in North Travancore
is of an antique type called atukkam-samkhu-chakkravum. Women in the
rural parts wear a curious neck ornament called anti-minnu. Of late,
all ornaments of N&#257;yar women are being worn by fashionable Izhava
females. But Izhava and N&#257;yar women can be distinguished by the
tie of the hair lock, the Izhava women usually bringing it to the
centre of the forehead, while the N&#257;yars place it on one side,
generally the left. Tattooing was once prevalent in South Travancore,
but is gradually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398"
name="pb398">398</a>]</span>losing favour. It was never in vogue in
North Travancore.</p>
<p>The Izhavas eat both fish and flesh. Rabbits, deer, pigs, sheep,
porcupines, fowls, doves, guinea-fowls, peacocks, and owls are believed
to make popular dishes. The sweetmeat called ariyunta, and the curry
known as mutirakkary, are peculiar to the Izhavas, and prepared best by
them.</p>
<p>The most important occupation of the Izhavas till recently was the
cultivation of palm trees, and the preparation of toddy and arrack.
Barbosa, writing in the sixteenth century, states that &ldquo;their
principal employment is to till the palm trees, and gather their
fruits; and to carry everything for hire from one point to another,
because they are not in the habit of transporting them with beasts of
burden, as there are none; and they hew stone, and gain their
livelihood by all kinds of labour. Some of them bear the use of arms,
and fight in the wars when it is necessary. They carry a staff in their
hand of a fathom&rsquo;s length as a sign of their lineage.&rdquo; With
the progress of culture and enlightenment, the occupation of extracting
liquor from the cocoanut palm has ceased to be looked upon with favour,
and such families as are now given to that pursuit have come to be
regarded as a low division of the Chovas. In some parts of Travancore,
the latter do not even enjoy the privilege of commensality with the
other Izhavas. Agriculture is a prominent profession, and there are
several wealthy and influential landlords in the community. There is
also a fair percentage of agricultural labourers. A preliminary rite,
called pozhutana sowing, is performed by farmers, who throw three
handfuls of rice seed on a clay image representing Gan&#275;sa, and
pray that their fields may yield a good harvest. Before the time of
reaping, on an auspicious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href=
"#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>morning, a few sheaves are
brought, and hung up in some prominent place in the house. This
ceremony is known as nira, and is common to all Hindu castes. At the
end of it, the inmates of the house partake of puttari or new rice.</p>
<p>There are a few other customary rites observed by agriculturists,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Metiyittu-varuka, or throwing the grains of the first sheaf upon
another, and covering it with its straw, this being afterwards
appropriated by the chief agricultural labourer present.</p>
<p>(2) Koytu-pitichcha-katta-kotukkuka, or handing over the first
sheaves of grain fastened together with <i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>
leaves to the owner of the field, who is obliged to preserve them till
the next harvest season.</p>
<p>(3) Kotuti, or offering of oblations of a few grains dipped in toddy
to the spirits of agricultural fields, the Pulaya priest crying aloud
&lsquo;Poli, v&#257;, poli, v&#257;,&rsquo; meaning literally May good
harvest come.</p>
<p>As manufacturers, the Izhavas occupy a position in Travancore. They
produce several kinds of cloth, for local consumption in the main, and
make mats, tiles, and ropes, with remarkable skill. They are also the
chief lemon-grass oil distillers of Travancore. In the professions of
medicine and astrology, the Izhavas have largely engaged themselves.
While it must be confessed that many of them are utter strangers to
culture, there are several who have received a sound education,
especially in Sanskrit. On the whole, the Izhavas may be said to be one
of the most industrious and prosperous communities on the west
coast.</p>
<p>The Izhavas form a pious and orthodox Hindu caste. Though they
cannot enter the inner court-yard of temples, they attend there in
considerable numbers, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href=
"#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>make their pious offerings. Over
several temples the Travancore Izhavas have a joint right with the
N&#257;yars. In illustration, the shrines of Saktikulamgara in
Karunagappali, and Chettikulangara in Mavelikara, may be mentioned.
Over these and other temples, the rights that have been enjoyed from
time immemorial by certain Izhava families are respected even at the
present day. In most places, the Izhavas have their own temples, with a
member of their own or the Izhavatti caste as priest. As no provision
had been made in them for daily worship, there was no necessity in
early times for the regular employment of priests. The deity usually
worshipped was Bhadrak&#257;li, who was believed to help them in their
military undertakings. The offerings made to her involved animal
sacrifices. The temples are generally low thatched buildings with a
front porch, an enclosure wall, and a grove of trees. There are many
instances, in which the enclosure wall is absent. The Bhadrak&#257;li
cult is gradually losing favour under the teaching of a Vedantic
scholar and religious reformer named Nanan Asan. In many Central and
South Travancore shrines, images of Subramania have been set up at his
instance, and daily worship is offered by bachelor priests appointed by
the castemen. An association for the social, material, and religious
amelioration of the community, called Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam,
has been started. Its head-quarters is at Aruvippuram in the
Nayyatinkara taluk. Every morning, the sun is specially worshipped by
the cultured class. In ancient times, the adoration of Anchu
Tampurakkal or the five deities, now identified with the P&#257;ndavas
of the Mah&#257;bharata, prevailed among these people. This worship is
found among the Pulayas also. At Mayyanad in Quilon, there is still an
Izhava temple dedicated to these five lords. Women visit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>shrines on all Mondays and Fridays, with a view
to worshipping Gauri, the consort of Siva. Male Izhavas devote the
first and last days of a month, as also that on which the star of their
nativity falls, to religious worship. The Izhavas of Central Travancore
pay homage to a spirit called K&#257;yalil Daivam, or the deity of
backwaters. When a village becomes infected with small-pox or cholera,
offerings are made to the Bhadrak&#257;li shrine in that locality. The
most important offering goes by the name of Kalam Vaikkuka, or pot
placing. A woman of the house of the local Panikkan or chief member
fasts, and, bearing a pot containing five nalis (a small measure) of
paddy (unhusked rice), proceeds to all the other Izhava houses in the
village, accompanied by musical instruments. One woman from every house
marches to the shrine with her offering of paddy and a chuckram (nearly
half an anna). The priest receives the offerings, converts the paddy
into rice, and, depositing a portion of it in each of the pots, hands
them back to the votaries on the morning of the next day. Another
ceremony performed on such occasions is called Desakuruti, when women
fast, and, taking all the food-stuffs necessary, proceed to the temple.
After the sacrifice of a goat and fowls by the priest, they make an
offering of the food to the deity before dinner. T&#363;kkam, or
suspension, is another propitiatory ceremony. A religious observance,
known as Mamachchirappu, finds favour with the Izhavas of Central
Travancore in the month of Vrischikam (November-December). Every Izhava
bathes in the evening, addresses the deities by their names for about
an hour, and then makes an offering of tender cocoanuts, fruits, and
fried grain. This takes place according to the convenience of each
family from twelve to forty-one days. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with the t&#363;kkam ceremony, Mr. L. K. Anantha
Krishna Aiyar writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8780src"
href="#xd21e8780" name="xd21e8780src">24</a> &ldquo;There are two kinds
of hook-swinging, namely Garuda (Brahmini kite) and thoni (boat)
t&#363;kkam. The ceremony is performed in fulfilment of a vow, to
obtain some favour of the deity K&#257;li, before whose presence it is
carried out. The performer of the ceremony should bathe early in the
morning, and be in a state of preparation either for a year or for
forty-one days by worshipping the deity Bhagavati. He must strictly
abstain from meat, all kinds of intoxicating liquors, and association
with women. During the morning hours, the performer dresses himself in
a garment tucked into the waist-band, rubs his body with oil, and is
shampooed particularly on the back, a portion of the flesh in the
middle of which is stretched for the insertion of a hook. He is also
taught by his instructor to perform various feats called payitta. This
he continues till the festival, when he has to swing in fulfilment of
the vow. In kite swinging, a kind of car, resting on two axles provided
with four wheels, is employed. On it, there is a horizontal beam
resting on two vertical supports. A strong rope tied to a ring attached
to the beam is connected with the hook which passes through the flesh
of the back. Over the beam there is a kutaram (tent), which is
tastefully decorated. Inside it, two or three persons can swing at a
time. There is a different arrangement in some places. Instead of the
beam and the supports, there is a small pole, on which rests a
horizontal beam provided with a metallic ring at one end. The beam acts
as a lever, so that one end of it can be either raised or lowered, so
as to give some rest to the swinger. The rope tied to the ring is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>connected with the hook and the waist-band. For
boat swinging, the same kind of vehicle, without wheels, is in use. For
kite swinging, the performer has his face painted green. He has to put
on artificial lips and wings in imitation of those of the kite, and
wears long locks of hair like those of an actor in a Kathakali. As he
swings, the car is taken three, five, seven, nine, or eleven times
round the temple. In boat swinging, the car is likewise carried round
the temple, with the swinger performing his feats, as in the case of
kite swinging, to the accompaniment of music. He has to put on the same
kind of dress, except the lips and wings. In pillayeduthut&#363;kkam,
or swinging with a child in fulfilment of a vow, the child is taken to
the temple by his parents, who pay to the temple authorities
thirty-four chuckrams in Travancore, and sixty-four puthans<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8785src" href="#xd21e8785" name=
"xd21e8785src">25</a> in Cochin. The child is then handed over to the
swinger, who carries the child as he swings. These performances are
sometimes made at the expense of the temple, but more generally of
persons who make the outlay in fulfilment of a vow. In the latter case,
it costs as much as Rs. 150 for the kite swinger, but only Rs. 30 for
the boat swinger. During the festival, they are fed in the temple,
owing to their being in a state of vow. It is the N&#257;yars,
Kamm&#257;lars, Kuruppans, and Izhavas, who perform the swinging in
fulfilment of a vow. In the fight between the goddess K&#257;li and the
demon Darika, the latter was completely defeated, and the former,
biting him on the back, drank his blood to gratify her feelings of
animosity. Hook-swinging symbolises this incident, and the bloodshed by
the insertion of the hook through the flesh is intended as an offering
to the goddess.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href=
"#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of the hook-swinging ceremony as performed a few years ago at the
Kollangadu temple in Travancore, an excellent account is given by the
Rev. T. Knowles,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8791src" href="#xd21e8791"
name="xd21e8791src">26</a> from which the following pr&eacute;cis has
been compiled. In front of the temple was a booth containing the image
of the goddess Bhadrak&#257;li, a cruel deity, who is supposed to
delight in blood. At a little distance was the car. The bottom part of
this was very much like a lorry used when transporting large logs of
timber by means of elephants. There were four solid wheels of thick
timber, with a frame work, like a railway waggon on a small scale. To
this were attached two thick cable ropes. Joined to the sides of the
car were two upright posts, about 15 feet high, strengthened with stays
and cross-pieces. On the top was a piece of thick timber with a hole in
it, and the bottom rounded, which fitted into a cross-piece, and
allowed the long beam on which the men were swung to move up or down.
This beam was 35 or 40 feet long, and about 9 inches in diameter. It
was placed through the hole in the piece of timber on the top of the
upright frame, and balanced in the middle like a huge see-saw. At one
end of the hole was a covered canopy, and at the other long ropes were
fastened, which trailed on the ground. The whole arrangement of the car
was such that, by lowering one end of the long beam to the ground, and
fastening a man to it, and then pulling down the other end by the
ropes, the man could be raised into the air to a height of some 40 feet
or more. The whole car could then be dragged by the thick cable ropes
round the temple. While the subject was being prepared for swinging, a
mat was stretched above his head, partly to do him honour, partly to
protect him from the sun. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405"
href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>head and neck were richly
ornamented, and below he was bedecked with peacock&rsquo;s feathers,
and clad in a loin-cloth, which would bear some, if not all the weight
of his body. Amid the firing of mortars, beating of tom-toms, the
screeching of flutes, and the shouts of the crowd, the canopied end of
the long beam was lowered, and the devotee, lying prone on the ground,
was fastened to the beam by means of ropes passing under his arms and
around his chest. To some of the ropes, hooks were fastened. The
priests took hold of the fleshy part of the man&rsquo;s back, squeezed
up the flesh, and put some four hooks at least through it. A rudely
fashioned sword and shield were then given to the man, and he was swung
up into the air, waving the sword and shield, and making convulsive
movements. Slowly the people dragged the car round the temple, a
distance not quite as far as round St. Paul&rsquo;s cathedral. Some of
the men were suspended while the car was dragged round three or four
times. The next devotee was fastened in the same way to the beam, but,
instead of a sword and shield, the priests gave him an infant in his
arms, and devotee and infant were swung up in the air, and the car
dragged round the temple as before. Some children were brought forward,
whose parents had made vows about them. The little ones were made to
prostrate themselves before the image of K&#257;li. Then the fleshy
parts of their sides were pinched up, and some wires put through. This
done, the wires were placed in the hands of the relatives, and the
children were led round and round the temple, as though in leading
strings. It is on record that, when the devotee has been specially
zealous, the whole machine has been moved to a considerable distance
while he was suspended from it, to the admiration of the gaping
multitudes.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406"
name="pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with the religion of the Ilavars, the Rev. S. Mateer
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8799src" href=
"#xd21e8799" name="xd21e8799src">27</a> &ldquo;Demon worship,
especially that of Bhadrak&#257;li, a female demon described as a
mixture of mischief and cruelty, is the customary cultus of the caste,
with sacrifices and offerings and devil-dancing like the
Sh&#257;n&#257;rs. Sh&#257;st&#257;vu and V&#299;rabhadran are also
venerated, and the ghosts of ancestors. Groves of trees stand near the
temples, and serpent images are common, these creatures being accounted
favourites of K&#257;li. They carry their superstitions and fear of the
demons into every department and incident of life. In some temples and
ceremonies, as at Paroor, Sarkarei, etc., they closely associate with
the S&#363;dras. The Ilavar temples are generally low, thatched
buildings, with front porch, a good deal of wooden railing and carving
about them, an enclosure wall, and a grove or a few trees, such as
<i>Ficus religiosa</i>, <i>Plumeria</i>, and <i>Bassia</i>. At the
Ilavar temple near Ch&#257;kki in the outskirts of Trevandrum, the
goddess Bhadrak&#257;li is represented as a female seated on an image,
having two wings, gilt and covered with serpents. Twice a year, fowls
and sheep are sacrificed by an Ilavan priest, and offerings of grain,
fruit, and flowers are presented. The side-piercing ceremony is also
performed here. A temple at Mangalattuk&#333;nam, about ten miles south
of Trevandrum, at which I witnessed the celebration of the annual
festival on the day following Meena Bharani, in March or April, may be
taken as a fair example of the whole. In connection with this temple
may be seen a peculiar wooden pillar and small shrine at the top,
somewhat like a pigeon-house. This is called a tani maram, and is a
kind of altar, or residence, for the demon M&#257;dan, resembling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>the temporary shrines on sticks or platforms
erected by the Pulayars. On it are carvings of many-headed serpents,
etc., and a projecting lamp for oil. For the festival, the ground
around the temple was cleared of weeds, the outhouses and sheds
decorated with flowers, and on the tani maram were placed two bunches
of plantains, at its foot a number of devil-dancing sticks. Close by
were five or six framework shrines, constructed of soft palm leaves and
pith of plantain tree, and ornamented with flowers. These were supposed
to be the residence of some minor powers, and in them were placed,
towards night, offerings of flowers, rice, plantains, cocoanuts, and
blood. The Ilavars who assemble for the festival wear the marks of
Siva, a dot and horizontal lines on the forehead, and three horizontal
lines of yellow turmeric on the chest. They begin to gather at the
temple from noon, and return home at night. The festival lasts for five
days. Some of the neighbouring S&#363;dras and Sh&#257;n&#257;rs also
attend, and some Pulayars, who pay one chuckram for two shots of
firework guns in fulfilment of their vows. Offerings here are generally
made in return for relief from sickness or trouble of some kind. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri, or priest, is an Ilavan, who receives donations of
money, rice, etc. A kind of mild hook-swinging ceremony is practised.
On the occasion referred to, four boys, about fifteen or sixteen years
of age, were brought. They must partly fast for five days previously on
plain rice and vegetable curry, and are induced to consent to the
operation, partly by superstitious fear, and partly by bribes. On the
one hand they are threatened with worse danger if they do not fulfil
the vows made by their parents to the d&#275;vi (deity); on the other
hand, if obedient, they receive presents of fine clothes and money.
Dressed in handsome cloths and turbans, and adorned with gold bracelets
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>and armlets, and garlands of flowers, the poor
boys are brought to present a little of their blood to the sanguinary
goddess. Three times they march round the temple; then an iron is run
through the muscles of each side, and small rattans inserted through
the wounds. Four men seize the ends of the canes, and all go round in
procession, with music and singing and clapping of hands, five or seven
times, according to their endurance, till quite exhausted. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri now dresses in a red cloth, with tinsel border, like a
Br&#257;hman, takes the dancing-club in hand, and dances before the
demon. Cocks are sacrificed, water being first poured upon the head;
when the bird shakes itself, the head is cut off, and the blood poured
round the temple. Rice is boiled in one of the sheds in a new pot, and
taken home with the fowls by the people for a feast in the house. At
Mayan&#257;du, the Bhagavathi of the small temple belonging to the
Ilavars is regarded as the sister of the one worshipped in the larger
temple used by the S&#363;dras, and served by a Br&#257;hman priest;
and the cars of the latter are brought annually to the Ilavar&rsquo;s
temple, and around it three times before returning to their own temple.
At the Ilavar&rsquo;s temple, the same night, the women boil rice in
new earthen pots, and the men offer sheep and fowls in sacrifice. In
further illustration of the strange superstitious practices of this
tribe, two more incidents may be mentioned. An Ilavatti, whose child
was unwell, went to consult an astrologer, who informed her that the
disease was caused by the spirit of the child&rsquo;s deceased
grandmother. For its removal he would perform various incantations, for
which he required the following, viz.:&mdash;water from seven wells,
dung from five cowsheds, a larva of the myrmeleon, a crab, a frog, a
green snake, a vir&#257;l fish, parched rice, ada cake, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>cocoanut, chilly, and green palm leaves. An
Ilavan, who had for some time been under Christian instruction, was led
away by a brother, who informed him that, if he built a small temple
for the worship of Nina M&#257;dan, and offered sacrifices, he should
find a large copper vessel full of gold coins hid underground, and
under the charge of this demon. The foolish man did so, but did not
find a single cash. Now the lying brother avers that the demon will not
be satisfied unless a human sacrifice is offered, which, of course, is
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The headmen of the Izhava caste are the Ch&#257;nnans and Panikkans,
invested with these titles by the Sovereigns of this State who have
been already referred to. The limits of their jurisdiction were
generally fixed in the charters received from them by their rulers, and
even to-day their authority remains supreme in all social matters. The
priests, it may be noted, are only a minor class, having no judicial
functions. Chief among the offences against the caste rules may be
mentioned non-observance of pollution, illicit connection,
non-performance of the t&#257;li-kettu before the age of puberty,
non-employment of the village barber and washerman, non-celebration of
ceremonies in one&rsquo;s own village, and so on. The headman comes to
know of these through the agency of the village barber or washerman,
and also a class of secondary dignitaries known as Kottilpattukar or
N&#257;luvitanmar. In every village, there are four families, invested
with this authority in olden times by the rulers of the State on
payment of fifty-nine fanams to the royal treasury. They are believed
to hold a fourth of the authority that pertains to the chieftain of the
village. If, on enquiry, an offence is proved, a fine is imposed on the
offender, which he is obliged to pay to the local shrine. If the
offence is grave, a feast has to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410"
href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>be given by him to the
villagers. In cases of failure, the services of the village priest and
washerman, and also the barber, are refused, and the culprit becomes
ostracised from society. The headman has to be paid a sum of ten
chuckrams on all occasions of ceremonies, and the N&#257;luvitanmar
four chuckrams each. There is a movement in favour of educating the
priests, and delegating some of the above powers to them.</p>
<p>Three forms of inheritance may be said to prevail among the Izhavas
of Travancore, viz.: (1) makkath&#257;yam (inheritance from father to
son) in the extreme south; (2) marumakkat&#257;yam (through the female
line) in all t&#257;luks to the north of Quilon; (3) a mixture of the
two between Neyyatinkara and that t&#257;luk. According to the mixed
mode, one&rsquo;s own children are not left absolutely destitute, but
some portion of the property is given them for maintenance, in no case,
however, exceeding a half. In families observing the
marumakkat&#257;yam law, male and female heirs own equal rights.
Partition, though possible when all consent, rarely takes place in
practice, the eldest male member holding in his hands the management of
the whole property. In Quilon and other places, the widow and her
children are privileged to remain in her husband&rsquo;s house for full
one year after his death, and enjoy all the property belonging to
him.</p>
<p>On the subject of inheritance, the Rev. S. Mateer writes as follows.
&ldquo;The nepotistic law of inheritance is, to a considerable extent,
followed by this caste. Those in the far south being more closely
connected with the Tamil people, their children inherit. Amongst the
Ilavars in Trevandrum district, a curious attempt is made to unite both
systems of inheritance, half the property acquired by a man after his
marriage, and during the lifetime of his wife, going to the issue of
such marriage, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>and half to the man&rsquo;s nepotistic heirs. In
a case decided by the Sadr Court, in 1872, the daughter of an Ilavan
claimed her share in the movable and immovable property of her deceased
father, and to have a sale made by him while alive declared null and
void to the extent of her share. As there was another similar heir, the
Court awarded the claimant a half share, and to this extent the claim
was invalidated. Their rules are thus stated by G. Kerala Varman
Tirumulp&#257;d:&mdash;&lsquo;If one marries and gives cloth to an
Ilavatti (female), and has issue, of the property acquired by him and
her from the time of the union, one-tenth is deducted for the
husband&rsquo;s labour or individual profit; of the remainder, half
goes to the woman and her children, and half to the husband and his
heirs (anandaravans). The property which an Ilavan has inherited or
earned before his marriage devolves solely to his anandaravans, not to
his children. If an Ilavatti has continued to live with her husband,
and she has no issue, or her children die before obtaining any share of
the property, when the husband dies possessing property earned by both,
his heirs and she must mutually agree, or the castemen decide what is
fair for her support; and the husband&rsquo;s heir takes the
remainder.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marriage of Izhava girls consists of two distinct rites, one
before they attain puberty called t&#257;li-kettu, and the other
generally after that period, but in some cases before, called
sambandham. It is, however, necessary that the girl must have her
t&#257;li tied before some one contracts sambandham with her. The
t&#257;li-tier may be, but often is not, as among the N&#257;yars, the
future husband of the girl. But, even for him, the relation will not be
complete without a formal cloth presentation. The legitimate union for
a person is with his maternal uncle&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>or
paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. Generally there is a separate ceremony
called Grihapravesam, or entrance into the house of the bridegroom
after sambandham. Widows may contract alliances with other persons
after the death of the first husband. In all cases, the Izhava husband
takes his wife home, and considers it <i>infra dig.</i> to stay in the
house of his father-in-law.</p>
<p>The method of celebrating the t&#257;li-kettu differs in different
parts of Travancore. The following is the form popular in Central
Travancore. All the elderly members of the village assemble at the
house of the girl, and fix a pillar of jack (<i>Artocarpus
integrifolia</i>) wood at the south-east corner. On the Kaniyan
(astrologer) being three times loudly consulted as to the
auspiciousness of the house he gives an affirmative reply, and the
guardian of the girl, receiving a silver ring from the goldsmith, hands
it over to the Vatti (priest), who ties it on the wooden post. The
carpenter, Kaniyan, and goldsmith receive some little presents. The
next item in the programme is the preparation of the rice necessary for
the marriage, and a quantity of paddy (unhusked rice) is brought by the
girl to the pandal ground, and formally boiled in a pot. The pandal
(booth) is generally erected on the south side of the house. The
chartu, or a chit from the Kaniyan, certifying the auspiciousness of
the match and the suitable date for its formal adoption, is taken by
the guardian and four Machchampis or Inangans to the headman of the
latter. These Machchampis are Izhavas of the village, equal in status
to the guardian of the girl. All the preliminary arrangements are now
over, and, on the day previous to the marriage, the girl bathes, and,
wearing the bleached cloths supplied by the Mann&#257;n (washerman),
worships the local deity, and awaits the arrival of the bridegroom. In
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>evening, the wife of the Vatti applies oil to
her hair, and after a bath the rite known as Kalati begins, as a
preliminary to which a thread passing through a silver ring is tied
round her right wrist. Kalati is recitation of various songs by the
women of the village before the girl. This is followed by
K&#257;njiramala, or placing the girl before a line of carved wooden
images, and songs by the Vatti women. On the following day, the girl is
introduced, at the auspicious hour, within the katirmandapa or raised
platform decorated with sheaves of corn within the pandal. The minnu or
marriage ornament, prepared by the goldsmith, is handed over to the
priest, along with two cloths to be worn by the bride and bridegroom. A
string is made of thread taken from these cloths, and the minnu
attached to it. The mother-in-law of the bridegroom now stands ready at
the gate, and, on his arrival, places a garland of flowers round his
neck. The new cloths are then presented by the Vatti and his wife to
the bridegroom and bride respectively, after some tender cocoanut
leaves, emblematic of the established occupation of the caste, are
thrust into the bridegroom&rsquo;s waist by the headman of the village.
In former days, a sword took the place of these leaves. The minnu is
then tied round the neck of the bride, and all parties, including the
parent or guardian, give presents to the bridegroom. The day&rsquo;s
ceremony is then over, and the bridegroom remains at the house of the
bride. The string is removed from the bride&rsquo;s wrist by the Vatti
on the fourth day, and the couple bathe. More than one girl may have
the t&#257;li tied at the same time, provided that there are separate
bridegrooms for them. Only boys from the families of Machchampis can
become t&#257;li-tiers.</p>
<p>The sambandham of North and Central Travancore differs from that of
South Travancore in some material <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414"
href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>respects. In the former, on
the appointed day, the bridegroom, who is a different person from the
t&#257;li-tier, accompanied by his relations and friends, arrives at
the bride&rsquo;s house, and the guardian of the former offers a sum of
money to the guardian of the latter. A suit of clothes, with ten
chuckrams or ten r&#257;sis (coins), is presented by the bridegroom to
the bride, who stands in a room within and receives it, being
afterwards dressed by his sister. The money goes by right to her
mother, and is known as Amm&#257;yippanam. Now comes the time for the
departure of the bride to her husband&rsquo;s house, when she receives
from her guardian a nut-cracker, lime-can, a dish filled with rice, and
a mat. A red cloth is thrown over her head, and a few members accompany
the party for some distance. In South Travancore, the bridegroom is
accompanied, besides others, by a companion, who asks in the midst of
the assembly whether they assent to the proposed alliance, and, on
their favourable reply, hands over a sum of money as an offering to the
local shrine. Another sum is given for the maintenance of the bride,
and, in the presence of the guardian, a suit of clothes is given to her
by the bridegroom. The wife is, as elsewhere, immediately taken to the
husband&rsquo;s house. This is called Kudivaippu, and corresponds to
the Grahapravesam celebrated by Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>The following account of marriage among the Izhavas of Malabar is
given in the Gazetteer of that district. &ldquo;A girl may be married
before puberty, but the consummation is not supposed to be effected
till after puberty, though the girl may live with her husband at once.
If the marriage is performed before puberty, the ceremony is apparently
combined with the t&#257;li-kettu kaly&#257;nam. The bride is fetched
from the d&#275;vapura or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href=
"#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>family chapel with a silk veil
over her head, and holding a betel leaf in her right hand in front of
her face. She stands in the pandal on a plank, on which there is some
rice. On her right stand four enangans of the bridegroom, and on her
left four of her own. The elder of the bridegroom&rsquo;s enangans
hands one of the bride&rsquo;s enangans a bundle containing the
t&#257;li, a mundu and p&#257;v&#257; (cloths), some rice, betel
leaves, and a coin called m&#275;ym&#275;lkanam, which should be of
gold and worth at least one rupee. All these are provided by the
bridegroom. He next hands the t&#257;li to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister, who ties it. After this, all the enangans scatter rice and
flowers over the bride. In this caste, the claim of a man to the hand
of his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter is recognised in the ceremony
called padikkal tada (obstruction at the gate), which consists of a
formal obstruction offered by eleven neighbours to the bride&rsquo;s
removal, when she is not so related to her husband They are bought off
by a fee of two fanams, and a packet of betel leaf. The girl is then
taken to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house. If very young, she is chaperoned
by a female relative. On the fourth day there is a feast at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house called n&#257;l&#257;m kaly&#257;nam and this
concludes the ceremonies. Marriage after puberty is called Pudamari.
The ceremonial is the same, but there is no padikkal tada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When an Izhava girl reaches puberty, the occasion is one for a four
days&rsquo; religious ceremonial. On the first day, the Vatti priestess
anoints the girl with oil, and after a bath, dresses her in the cloth
supplied by the Mann&#257;tti (washerwoman). She is then laid on a
broad wooden plank, and is supposed not to go out until she bathes on
the fourth day. All the female relations of the family present her with
sweetmeats. On the seventh <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href=
"#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>day, she is again taken to and
from the village tank (pond) with much &eacute;clat, and, on her
return, she either treads on cloths spread on the floor, or is carried
by an elderly woman. After this, she husks a quantity of paddy, and
cooks the rice obtained thence. If this ceremony takes place at the
house of a headman, the villagers present him with a vessel full of
sugared rice.</p>
<p>A two days&rsquo; ceremonial, called Pulikudi in north Travancore,
and Vayattu Pongala in the south, which corresponds to the Pumsavana of
Br&#257;hmans, is observed at the seventh month of pregnancy. On the
first day, at twilight in the evening, the pregnant woman, preceded by
the priestess, proceeds to the foot of a tamarind tree on the southern
side of the compound. Arriving there, she receives a thread seven yards
in length, to which a silver ring is attached at one end, and, by means
of circumambulation, entwines the tree with the thread. If the thread
is by chance or inadvertence broken during this process, the popular
belief is that either the mother or the child will die soon. Next day,
the thread is unwound from the tree, and a handful of tamarind leaves
is given to the woman by her husband. On re-entering the house,
tamarind juice is poured through the hands of the husband into those of
the wife, who drinks it. The priestess then pours a quantity of oil on
the navel of the woman from a betel leaf, and, from the manner in which
it flows down, it is believed that she is able to determine the sex of
the unborn child. The woman has to lean against a cutting of an
ambazham (<i>Spondias mangifera</i>) tree while she is drinking the
juice, and this cutting has to be planted in some part of the compound.
If it does not grow properly, the adversity of the progeny is
considered to be sealed. The husband is given a ring and other presents
on this occasion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417"
name="pb417">417</a>]</span>Women bathe on the third, fifth, and
nineteenth day after delivery, and wear the m&#257;ttu or changed cloth
of the Mann&#257;tti, in order to be freed from pollution. The
name-giving ceremony of the child takes place on the twenty-eighth day.
It is decorated with a pair of iron anklets, and a ribbon passed
through a few pieces of iron is tied round its waist. It is then held
standing on a vessel filled with rice, and, its left ear being closed,
a name is muttered by its guardian into the right ear. The first
feeding ceremony is observed in the sixth month, when the iron
ornaments are removed, and replaced by silver and gold ones. The
ear-boring ceremony takes place at an auspicious hour on some day
before the child attains its seventh year.</p>
<p>In former times, only the eldest male member of a family was
cremated, but no such restriction obtains at the present day. When a
member of the community dies, three handfuls of rice are placed in the
mouth of the corpse by the eldest heir after a bath, followed by the
sons, nephews, and grandsons of the deceased. Every relative throws an
unbleached cloth over the corpse, after which it is taken to the
burning-ground, where the pyre is lighted by the heir with a
consecrated torch handed to him by the priest. A wooden plank is
furnished by the carpenter, and an impression of the foot of the
deceased smeared with sandal paste is made on it. The name, and date of
the death of the deceased, are inscribed thereon, and it has to be
carefully preserved in the house of the heir. The record refreshes his
memory on occasions of sr&#257;dh (memorial service), etc. When the
cremation is half completed, the contents of a tender cocoanut are
placed beside the head of the corpse as an offering, and prayers are
muttered. A pot full of water is then borne by the chief mourner on his
shoulder <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span>thrice round the corpse. As he does so, the
priest pricks the pot thrice with an iron instrument. Finally, the pot
is broken on the pyre, and the chief mourner returns home without
turning back and looking at the corpse. On the second day, an oblation
of food (pinda) is offered to the departed. The inmates of the house
are fed with conji (rice gruel) on this day by the relatives. The
Sanchayana, or collection of bones, takes place on the fifth day.
Pollution lasts for fifteen days in Central and North Travancore, but
only for ten days in the south. There are some rites, not observed
necessarily by all members of the caste, on the forty-first day, and at
the end of the first year. Persons who have died of contagious
diseases, women who die after conception or on delivery, and children
under five years of age, are buried. Pollution is observed only for
nine days when children die; and, in the case of men who die of
contagious disease, a special group of ceremonies is performed by the

<p class="first"><b>J&#257;da.</b>&mdash;J&#257;da or J&#257;ndra,
meaning great men, has been recorded as a synonym of D&#275;v&#257;nga
and Kurni.</p>
<p><b>Jagg&#257;li.</b>&mdash;The Jagg&#257;lis are defined, in the
Manual of the Ganjam district, as Uriya workers in leather in Ganjam.
It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the
traditional occupation of this caste was apparently leatherworking, but
now it is engaged in cultivation and miscellaneous labour. Its members
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=

outcastes from other communities to their ranks on payment of a small
fee. Marriage is either infant or adult, and widows and
divorc&eacute;es may remarry. S&#257;t&#257;nis are employed as
priests. They eat beef and pork, and drink alcohol. They bury their
dead. In some places they work as syces (grooms), and in others as
firewood-sellers and as labourers. P&#257;tro and B&#275;hara are their
titles.&rdquo; It may, I think, be accepted that the Jagg&#257;lis are
Telugu M&#257;digas, who have settled in Ganjam, and learnt the Oriya
language. It is suggested that the name is derived from the Oriya
jagiba, watching, as some are village crop-watchers.</p>
<p><b>Jaikonda</b> (lizard).&mdash;A sept of D&#333;mb.</p>
<p><b>Jain.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;Few,&rdquo; Mr. T. A. Gopinatha Rao
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8887src" href="#xd21e8887" name=
"xd21e8887src">1</a> &ldquo;even among educated persons, are aware of
the existence of Jainas and Jaina centres in Southern India. The Madras
Presidency discloses vestiges of Jaina dominion almost everywhere, and
on many a roadside a stone T&#299;rthankara, standing or sitting
cross-legged, is a common enough sight. The present day interpretations
of these images are the same all over the Presidency. If the images are
two, one represents a debtor and the other a creditor, both having met
on the road, and waiting to get their accounts settled and cleared. If
it is only one image, it represents a debtor paying penalty for not
having squared up his accounts with his creditor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;out
of a total of 25,716 Jains, as many as 22,273 have returned both caste
and sub-division as Jain. The remainder have returned 22 sub-divisions,
of which some, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>such as Digambara and Swetambara, are sectarian
rather than caste divisions, but others like Marv&#257;di, Osval,
Vell&#257;lan, etc., are distinct castes. And the returns also show
that some Jains have returned well-known castes as their main castes,
for we have Jain Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, Gaudas, Vell&#257;las, etc.
The Jain Bants, however, have all returned Jain as their main
caste.&rdquo; At the Madras census, 1901, 27,431 Jains were returned.
Though they are found in nearly every district of the Madras
Presidency, they occur in the largest number in the
following:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>At the Mysore census, 1901, 13,578 Jains were returned. It is
recorded in the report that &ldquo;the Digambaras and Swetambaras are
the two main divisions of the Jain faith. The root of the word
Digambara means space clad or sky clad, <i>i.e.</i>, nude, while
Swetambara means clad in white. The Swetambaras are found more in
Northern India, and are represented but by a small number in Mysore.
The Digambaras are said to live absolutely separated from society, and
from all <span class="corr" id="xd21e8922" title=
"Source: wordly">worldly</span> ties. These are generally engaged in
trade, selling mostly brass and copper vessels, and are scattered all
over the country, the largest number of them being found in Shimoga,
Mysore, and Hassan districts. Sr&#257;vana Belagola, in the Hassan
district, is a chief seat of the Jains of the province.
T&#299;rthankaras are the priests of the Jain religion, and are also
known as Pitambaras. The Jain Yatis or clergy here belong to the
Digambara sect, and cover themselves with a yellow robe, and hence the
name Pithambara.&rdquo; The D&#257;sa Banajigas of Mysore style
themselves Jaina Kshatriya R&#257;m&#257;nujas. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with the terms Digambara and Swetambara, it is noted
by B&uuml;hler<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8928src" href="#xd21e8928"
name="xd21e8928src">2</a> that &ldquo;Digambara, that is those whose
robe is the atmosphere, owe their name to the circumstance that they
regard absolute nudity as the indispensable sign of holiness, though
the advance of civilization has compelled them to depart from the
practice of their theory. The Swetambara, that is they who are clothed
in white, do not claim this doctrine, but hold it as possible that the
holy ones who clothe themselves may also attain the highest goal. They
allow, however, that the founder of the Jaina religion and his first
disciples disdained to wear clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most important Jain settlement in Southern India at the present
day is at Sr&#257;vana Belagola in Mysore, where the Jains are employed
in the manufacture of metal vessels for domestic use. The town is
situated at the base of two hills, on the summit of one of which, the
Indra Betta, is the colossal statue of Gomat&#275;svara, Gummatta, or
Gomata R&#257;ya,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8933src" href="#xd21e8933"
name="xd21e8933src">3</a> concerning which Mr. L. Rice writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8936src" href="#xd21e8936" name=
"xd21e8936src">4</a> &ldquo;The image is nude, and stands erect, facing
the north. The figure has no support above the thighs. Up to that point
it is represented as surrounded by ant-hills, from which emerge
serpents. A climbing plant twines itself round both legs and both arms,
terminating at the upper part of the arm in a cluster of fruit or
berries. The pedestal on which the feet stand is carved to represent an
open lotus. The hair is in spiral ringlets, flat to the head, as usual
in Jain images, and the lobe of the ears lengthened down with a large
rectangular hole. The extreme <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422"
href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>height of the figure may be
stated at 57 feet, though higher estimates have been given&mdash;60
feet 3 inches by Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington),
and 70 feet 3 inches by Buchanan.&rdquo; Of this figure, Fergusson
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8941src" href="#xd21e8941" name=
"xd21e8941src">5</a> that nothing grander or more imposing exists
anywhere out of Egypt, and even there no known statue surpasses it in
height, though, it must be confessed, they do excel it in the
perfection of art they exhibit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other colossal statues of Gummata are situated on the summit of
hills outside the towns of Karkal and V&#275;n&#363;r or
Y&#275;n&#363;r in South Canara. Concerning the former, Dr. E. Hultzsch
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8946src" href=
"#xd21e8946" name="xd21e8946src">6</a> &ldquo;It is a monolith
consisting of the figure itself, of a slab against which it leans, and
which reaches up to the wrists, and of a round pedestal which is sunk
into a thousand-petalled lotus flower. The legs and arms of the figure
are entwined with vines (dr&acirc;ksh&acirc;). On both sides of the
feet, a number of snakes are cut out of the slab against which the
image leans. Two inscriptions<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8949src" href=
"#xd21e8949" name="xd21e8949src">7</a> on the sides of the same slab
state that this image of B&#257;hubalin or Gummata Jinapati was set up
by a chief named V&icirc;ra-P&acirc;ndya, the son of Bhairava, in A.D.
1431&ndash;32. An inscription of the same chief is engraved on a
graceful stone pillar in front of the outer gateway. This pillar bears
a seated figure of Brahmad&ecirc;va, a chief of Pattipombuchcha, the
modern Humcha in Mysore, who, like V&icirc;ra-P&acirc;ndya, belonged to
the family of Jinadatta, built the Chaturmukha basti in A.D.
1586&ndash;87. As its name (chaturmukha, the four-faced) implies, this
temple has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>four doors, each of which opens on three black
stone figures of the three T&#299;rthankaras Ari, Malli, and
Munisuvrata. Each of the figures has a golden aureole over the
head.&rdquo; According to a legend recorded by Mr. M. J.
Walhouse,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8954src" href="#xd21e8954" name=
"xd21e8954src">8</a> the Karkal statue, when finished, was raised on to
a train of twenty iron carts furnished with steel wheels, on each of
which ten thousand propitiatory cocoanuts were broken and covered with
an infinity of cotton. It was then drawn by legions of worshippers up
an inclined plane to the platform on the hill-top where it now
stands.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Statue of Gummata at Karkai.</p>

<p>The legend of Kalkuda, who is said to have made the colossal statue
at &ldquo;Belgula,&rdquo; is narrated at length by Mr. A. C.
Burnell.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8965src" href="#xd21e8965" name=
"xd21e8965src">9</a> Told briefly, the story is as follows. Kalkuda
made a Gummata two cubits higher than at B&#275;l&#363;r. Bairanasuda,
King of Karkal, sent for him to work in his kingdom. He made the
Gummatas&#257;mi. Although five thousand people were collected
together, they were not able to raise the statue. Kalkuda put his left
hand under it, and raised it, and set it upright on a base. He then
said to the king &ldquo;Give me my pay, and the present that you have
to give to me. It is twelve years since I left my house, and came
here.&rdquo; But the king said &ldquo;I will not let Kalkuda, who has
worked in my kingdom, work in another country,&rdquo; and cut off his
left hand and right leg. Kalkuda then went to Timman&#257;jila, king of
Y&#275;n&#363;r, and made a Gummata two cubits higher than that at
Karkal.</p>
<p>In connection with the figure at Sr&#257;vana Belagola, Fergusson
suggests<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8970src" href="#xd21e8970" name=
"xd21e8970src">10</a> that the hill had a mass or tor standing on its
summit, which the Jains fashioned into a statue. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span></p>
<p>The high priest of the Jain basti at Karkal in 1907 gave as his name
Lalitha Kirthi Bhattaraka Pattacharya Variya Jiyasw&#257;migalu. His
full-dress consisted of a red and gold-embroidered Benares body-cloth,
red and gold turban, and, as a badge of office, a brush of
peacock&rsquo;s feathers mounted in a gold handle, carried in his hand.
On ordinary occasions, he carried a similar brush mounted in a silver
handle. The abhish&#275;kam ceremony is performed at Karkal at
intervals of many years. A scaffold is erected, and over the colossal
statue are poured water, milk, flowers, cocoanuts, sugar, jaggery,
sugar-candy, gold and silver flowers, fried rice, beans, gram, sandal
paste, nine kinds of precious stones, etc.</p>
<p>Concerning the statue at Y&#275;n&#363;r, Mr. Walhouse
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8979src" href="#xd21e8979" name=
"xd21e8979src">11</a> that &ldquo;it is lower than the K&acirc;rkala
statue (41&frac12; feet), apparently by three or four feet. It
resembles its brother colossi in all essential particulars, but has the
special peculiarity of the cheeks being dimpled with a deep grave
smile. The salient characteristics of all these colossi are the broad
square shoulders, and the thickness and remarkable length of the arms,
the tips of the fingers, like Rob Roy&rsquo;s, nearly reaching the
knees. [One of Sir Thomas Munro&rsquo;s good qualities was that, like
R&#257;ma, his arms reached to his knees or, in other words, he
possessed the quality of an &#256;janub&#257;hu, which is the heritage
of kings, or those who have blue blood in them.] Like the others, this
statue has the lotus enwreathing the legs and arms, or, as Dr. Burnell
suggests, it may be jungle creepers, typical of wrapt meditation.
[There is a legend that B&#257;hubalin was so absorbed in meditation in
a forest that climbing plants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425"
href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span>grew over him.] A
triple-headed cobra rises up under each hand, and there are others
lower down.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Jain basti at Mudabidure.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The village of M&#363;dabidure in the South Canara
district,&rdquo; Dr. Hultzsch writes, &ldquo;is the seat of a Jaina
high priest, who bears the title
Ch&acirc;rukirti-Pandit&acirc;ch&acirc;rya-Sv&acirc;min. He resides in
a matha, which is known to contain a large library of Jaina
manuscripts. There are no less than sixteen Jaina temples (basti) at
M&ucirc;dabidure. Several of them are elaborate buildings with massive
stone roofs, and are surrounded by laterite enclosures. A special
feature of this style of architecture is a lofty monolithic column
called m&acirc;nastambha, which is set up in front of seven of the
bastis. In two of them a flagstaff (dhvajastambha), which consists of
wood covered with copper, is placed between the m&acirc;nastambha and
the shrine. Six of them are called Settarabasti, and accordingly must
have been built by Jaina merchants (Setti). The sixteen bastis are
dedicated to the following T&icirc;rthankaras:&mdash;Chandranatha or
Chandraprabha, N&ecirc;min&acirc;tha, P&acirc;rsvan&acirc;tha,
&Acirc;din&acirc;tha, Mallin&acirc;tha, Padmaprabha, Anantan&acirc;tha,
Vardham&acirc;na, and S&acirc;ntin&acirc;tha. In two of these bastis
are separate shrines dedicated to all the T&icirc;rthankaras, and in
another basti the shrines of two Yaksh&#299;s. The largest and finest
is the Hosabasti, <i>i.e.</i>, the new temple, which is dedicated to
Chandran&acirc;tha, and was built in A.D. 1429&ndash;30. It possesses a
double enclosure, a very high m&acirc;nastambha, and a sculptured
gateway. The uppermost storey of the temple consists of wood-work. The
temple is composed of the shrine (garbagriha), and three rooms in front
of it, viz., the T&icirc;rthakaramandapa, the Gaddigemandapa, and the
Chitramandapa. In front of the last-mentioned mandapa is a separate
building called Bhair&acirc;d&ecirc;vimandapa, which was built in A.D.
1451&ndash;52. Round its base runs a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb426" href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>band of sculptures,
among which the figure of a giraffe deserves to be noted. The idol in
the dark innermost shrine is said to consist of five metals
(pancha-l&ocirc;ha), among which silver predominates. The basti next in
importance is the Gurugalabasti, where two ancient talipot
(sr&icirc;t&acirc;lam) copies of the Jaina Siddh&acirc;nta are
preserved in a box with three locks, the keys of which are in charge of
three different persons. The minor bastis contain three rooms, viz.,
the Garbhagriha, the T&icirc;rthakaramandapa, and the
Namask&acirc;ramandapa. One of the sights of M&ucirc;dabidire is the
ruined palace of the Chautar, a local chief who follows the Jaina
creed, and is in receipt of a pension from the Government. The
principal objects of interest at the palace are a few nicely-carved
wooden pillars. Two of them bear representations of the
pancha-n&acirc;r&icirc;turaga, <i>i.e.</i>, the horse composed of five
women, and the nava-n&acirc;r&icirc;-kunjara, <i>i.e.</i>, the elephant
composed of nine women. These are fantastic animals, which are formed
by the bodies of a number of shepherdesses for the amusement of their
Lord Krishna. The Jains are divided into two classes, viz., priests
(indra) and laymen (srivaka). The former consider themselves as
Br&acirc;hmanas by caste. All the Jainas wear the sacred thread. The
priests dine with the laymen, but do not intermarry with them. The
former practice the makkalasant&acirc;na, <i>i.e.</i>, the inheritance
through sons, and the latter aliya-sant&acirc;na, <i>i.e.</i>, the
inheritance through nephews. The Jainas are careful to avoid pollution
from contact with outcastes, who have to get out of their way in the
road, as I noticed myself. A Jaina marriage procession, which I saw
passing, was accompanied by Hindu dancing-girls. Near the western end
of the street in which most of the Jainas live, a curious spectacle
presents itself. From a number of high trees, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>thousands of flying foxes (fruit-bat,
<i>Pteropus medius</i>) are suspended. They have evidently selected the
spot as a residence, because they are aware that the Jainas, in
pursuance of one of the chief tenets of their religion, do not harm any
animals. Following the same street further west, the Jaina
burial-ground is approached. It contains a large ruined tank with
laterite steps, and a number of tombs of wealthy Jain merchants. These
tombs are pyramidal structures of several storeys, and are surmounted
by a water-pot (kalasa) of stone. Four of the tombs bear short
epitaphs. The Jainas cremate their dead, placing the corpse on a stone
in order to avoid taking the life of any stray insect during the
process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their ceremonials, <i>e.g.</i>, marriage rites, the Jains of
South Canara closely follow the Bants. They are worshippers of
bh&#363;thas (devils), and, in some houses, a room called pad&#333;li
is set apart, in which the bh&#363;tha is kept. When they make vows,
animals are not killed, but they offer metal images of fowls, goats, or
pigs.</p>
<p>Of the Jains of the North Arcot district, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9027src" href="#xd21e9027" name=
"xd21e9027src">12</a> that &ldquo;more than half of them are found in
the Wandiwash taluk, and the rest in Arcot and P&#333;l&#363;r. Their
existence in this neighbourhood is accounted for by the fact that a
Jain dynasty reigned for many years in Conjeeveram. They must at one
time have been very numerous, as their temples and sculptures are found
in very many places, from which they themselves have now disappeared.
They have most of the Br&#257;hman ceremonies, and wear the sacred
thread, but look down upon Br&#257;hmans as degenerate followers of an
originally pure faith. For this reason they object generally to
accepting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>ghee (clarified butter) or jaggery (crude
sugar), etc., from any but those of their own caste. They are defiled
by entering a Pariah village, and have to purify themselves by bathing
and assuming a new thread. The usual caste affix is Nainar, but a few,
generally strangers from other districts, are called Rao, Chetti,
D&#257;s, or Mudaliyar.</p>
<p>At Pillap&#257;laiyam, a suburb of Conjeeveram in the Chingleput
district, is a Jain temple of considerable artistic beauty. It is noted
by Sir M. E. Grant Duff<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9034src" href=
"#xd21e9034" name="xd21e9034src">13</a> that this is &ldquo;left
unfinished, as it would seem, by the original builders, and adapted
later to the Shivite worship. Now it is abandoned by all its
worshippers, but on its front stands the census number
9&ndash;A&mdash;emblematic of the new order of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Jains of the South Arcot district, Mr. W. Francis
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9040src" href="#xd21e9040" name=
"xd21e9040src">14</a> that &ldquo;there is no doubt that in ancient
days the Jain faith was powerful in this district. The Periya
Pur&#257;nam says that there was once a Jain monastery and college at
P&#257;taliputra, the old name for the modern Tirup&#257;puliy&#363;r,
and remains of Jain images and sculptures are comparatively common in
the district. The influence of the religion doubtless waned in
consequence of the great Saivite revival, which took place in the early
centuries of the present era, and the Periya Pur&#257;nam gives a story
in connection therewith, which is of local interest. It says that the
Saivite poet-saint Appar was at one time a student in the Jain college
at P&#257;taliputra, but was converted to Saivism in consequence of the
prayers of his sister, who was a devotee of the deity in the temple at
Tiruv&#257;di near Panruti. The local king was a Jain, and was at first
enraged with Appar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429"
name="pb429">429</a>]</span>for his fervent support of his new faith.
But eventually he was himself induced by Appar to become a Saivite, and
he then turned the P&#257;liputra monastery into a temple to Siva, and
ordered the extirpation of all Jains. Later on there was a Jain
revival, but this in its turn was followed by another persecution of
the adherents of that faith. The following story connected with this
latter occurs in one of the Mackenzie Manuscripts, and is supported by
existing tradition. In 1478 A.D., the ruler of Gingee was one
Venkat&#257;mp&#275;tta&#299;, Venkatapati,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9045src" href="#xd21e9045" name="xd21e9045src">15</a> who
belonged to the comparatively low caste of the Kavarais. He asked the
local Br&#257;hmans to give him one of their daughters to wife. They
said that, if the Jains would do so, they would follow suit.
Venkatapati told the Jains of this answer, and asked for one of their
girls as a bride. They took counsel among themselves how they might
avoid the disgrace of connecting themselves by marriage with a man of
such a caste, and at last pretended to agree to the king&rsquo;s
proposal, and said that the daughter of a certain prominent Jain would
be given him. On the day fixed for the marriage, Venkatapati went in
state to the girl&rsquo;s house for the ceremony, but found it deserted
and empty, except for a bitch tied to one of the posts of the verandah.
Furious at the insult, he issued orders to behead all Jains. Some of
the faith were accordingly decapitated, others fled, others again were
forced to practice their rites secretly, and yet others became Saivites
to escape death. Not long afterwards, some of the king&rsquo;s officers
saw a Jain named V&#299;ras&#275;n&#257;ch&#257;rya performing the
rites peculiar to his faith in a well in V&#275;l&#363;r near
Tindivanam, and <span class="corr" id="xd21e9048" title=
"Source: hailed">hauled</span> him before their master. The latter,
however, had just had a child born to him, was in a good <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>temper, and let the accused go free; and
V&#299;ras&#275;n&#257;ch&#257;rya, sobered by his narrow escape from
death, resolved to become an ascetic, went to Sr&#257;vana Belgola, and
there studied the holy books of the Jain religion. Meanwhile another
Jain of the Gingee country, G&#257;ngayya Udaiy&#257;r of
T&#257;yan&#363;r in the Tindivanam taluk, had fled to the protection
of the Zamindar of Udaiy&#257;rp&#257;laiyam in Trichinopoly, who
befriended him and gave him some land. Thus assured of protection, he
went to Sr&#257;vana Belgola, fetched back
V&#299;ras&#275;n&#257;ch&#257;rya, and with him made a tour through
the Gingee country, to call upon the Jains who remained there to return
to their ancient faith. These people had mostly become Saivites, taken
off their sacred threads and put holy ashes on their foreheads, and the
name N&#299;rp&#363;si Vell&#257;las, or the Vell&#257;las who put on
holy ash, is still retained. The mission was successful, and Jainism
revived. V&#299;ras&#275;n&#257;ch&#257;rya eventually died at
V&#275;l&#363;r, and there, it is said, is kept in a temple a metal
image of Parsvan&#257;tha, one of the twenty-four T&#299;rthankaras,
which he brought from Sr&#257;vana Belgola. The descendants of
G&#257;ngayya Udaiy&#257;r still live in T&#257;yan&#363;r, and, in
memory of the services of their ancestor to the Jain cause, they are
given the first betel and leaf on festive occasions, and have a leading
voice in the election of the high-priest at Sitt&#257;m&#363;r in the
Tindivanam taluk. This high-priest, who is called Mah&#257;dhipati, is
elected by representatives from the chief Jain villages. These are, in
Tindivanam taluk, Sitt&#257;m&#363;r itself, V&#299;ran&#257;m&#363;r,
Vilukkam, Peram&#257;nd&#363;r, Alagr&#257;mam, and the V&#275;l&#363;r
and T&#257;yan&#363;r already mentioned. The high-priest has supreme
authority over all Jains south of Madras, but not over those in Mysore
or South Canara, with whom the South Arcot community have no relations.
He travels round in a palanquin with a suite of followers to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>chief centres&mdash;his expenses being paid by
the communities he visits&mdash;settles caste disputes, and fines, and
excommunicates the erring. His control over his people is still very
real, and is in strong contrast to the waning authority of many of the
Hindu gurus. The Jain community now holds a high position in Tindivanam
taluk, and includes wealthy traders and some of quite the most
intelligent agriculturists there. The men use the title of Nayin&#257;r
or Udaiy&#257;r, but their relations in Kumbak&#333;nam and elsewhere
in that direction sometimes call themselves Chetti or Mudaliy&#257;r.
The women are great hands at weaving mats from the leaves of the
date-palm. The men, except that they wear the thread, and paint on
their foreheads a sect-mark which is like the ordinary Vaishnavite
mark, but square instead of semi-circular at the bottom, and having a
dot instead of a red streak in the middle, in general appearance
resemble Vell&#257;las. They are usually clean shaved. The women dress
like Vell&#257;las, and wear the same kind of t&#257;li (marriage
emblem) and other jewellery. The South Arcot Jains all belong to the
Digambara sect, and the images in their temples of the twenty-four
T&#299;rthankaras are accordingly without clothing. These temples, the
chief of which are those at Tirunirankonrai<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9056src" href="#xd21e9056" name="xd21e9056src">16</a> and
Sitt&#257;m&#363;r, are not markedly different in external appearance
from Hindu shrines, but within these are images of some of the
T&#299;rthankaras, made of stone or of painted clay, instead of
representations of the Hindu deities. The Jain rites of public worship
much resemble those of the Br&#257;hmans. There is the same bathing of
the god with sacred oblations, sandal, and so on; the same lighting and
waving of lamps, and burning of camphor; and the same breaking of
cocoanuts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span>playing of music, and reciting of sacred verses.
These ceremonies are performed by members of the Archaka or priest
class. The daily private worship in the houses is done by the laymen
themselves before a small image of one of the T&#299;rthankaras, and
daily ceremonies resembling those of the Br&#257;hmans, such as the
pronouncing of the sacred mantram at daybreak, and the recital of forms
of prayer thrice daily, are observed. The Jains believe in the doctrine
of re-births, and hold that the end of all is Nirv&#257;na. They keep
the Sivar&#257;tri and D&#299;p&#257;vali feasts, but say that they do
so, not for the reasons which lead Hindus to revere these dates, but
because on them the first and the last of the twenty-four
T&#299;rthankaras attained beatitude. Similarly they observe Pongal and
the Ayudha p&#363;ja day. They adhere closely to the injunctions of
their faith prohibiting the taking of life, and, to guard themselves
from unwittingly infringing them, they do not eat or drink at night
lest they might thereby destroy small insects which had got unseen into
their food. For the same reason, they filter through a cloth all milk
or water which they use, eat only curds, ghee and oil which they have
made themselves with due precautions against the taking of insect life,
or known to have been similarly made by other Jains, and even avoid the
use of shell chunam (lime). The V&#275;dakk&#257;rans (shik&#257;ri or
hunting caste) trade on these scruples by catching small birds,
bringing them to Jain houses, and demanding money to spare their lives.
The Jains have four sub-divisions, namely, the ordinary laymen, and
three priestly classes. Of the latter, the most numerous are the
Archakas (or V&#257;dy&#257;rs). They do the worship in the temples. An
ordinary layman cannot become an Archaka; it is a class apart. An
Archaka can, however, rise to the next higher of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>priestly classes, and become what is called an
Annam or Annuvriti, a kind of monk who is allowed to marry, but has to
live according to certain special rules of conduct. These Annams can
again rise to the highest of the three classes, and become
Nirv&#257;nis or Munis, monks who lead a celibate life apart from the
world. There is also a sisterhood of nuns, called Ary&#257;nganais, who
are sometimes maidens, and sometimes women who have left their
husbands, but must in either case take a vow of chastity. The monks
shave their heads, and dress in red; the nuns similarly shave, but wear
white. Both of them carry as marks of their condition a brass vessel
and a bunch of peacock&rsquo;s feathers, with which latter they sweep
clean any place on which they sit down, lest any insect should be
there. To both classes the other Jains make namask&#257;ram (respectful
salutation) when they meet them, and both are maintained at the cost of
the rest of the community. The laymen among the Jains will not
intermarry, though they will dine with the Archakas, and these latter
consequently have the greatest trouble in procuring brides for their
sons, and often pay Rs. 200 or Rs. 300 to secure a suitable match.
Otherwise there are no marriage sub-divisions among the community, all
Jains south of Madras freely intermarrying. Marriage takes place either
before or after puberty. Widows are not allowed to remarry, but are not
required to shave their heads until they are middle-aged. The dead are
burnt, and the death pollution lasts for twelve days, after which
period purification is performed, and the parties must go to the
temple. Jains will not eat with Hindus. Their domestic ceremonies, such
as those of birth, marriage, death and so on resemble generally those
of the Br&#257;hmans. A curious difference is that, though the girls
never wear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>the thread, they are taught the thread-wearing
mantram, amid all the ceremonies usual in the case of boys, when they
are about eight years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the report on Epigraphy, 1906&ndash;1907, that at
Eyil in the South Arcot district the Jains asked the Collector for
permission to use the stones of the Siva temple for repairing their
own. The Collector called upon the Hindus to put the Siva temple in
order within a year, on pain of its being treated as an escheat.</p>
<p>Near the town of Madura is a large isolated mass of naked rock,
which is known as &#256;naimalai (elephant hill). &ldquo;The Madura
Sthala Pur&#257;na says it is a petrified elephant. The Jains of
Conjeeveram, says this chronicle, tried to convert the Saivite people
of Madura to the Jain faith. Finding the task difficult, they had
recourse to magic. They dug a great pit ten miles long, performed a
sacrifice thereon, and thus caused a huge elephant to arise from it.
This beast they sent against Madura. It advanced towards the town,
shaking the whole earth at every step, with the Jains marching close
behind it. But the P&#257;ndya king invoked the aid of Siva, and the
god arose and slew the elephant with his arrow at the spot where it now
lies petrified.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9070src" href=
"#xd21e9070" name="xd21e9070src">17</a></p>
<p>In connection with the long barren rock near Madura called
N&#257;gamalai (snake hill), &ldquo;local legends declare that it is
the remains of a huge serpent, brought into existence by the magic arts
of the Jains, which was only prevented by the grace of Siva from
devouring the fervently Saivite city it so nearly
approaches.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9075src" href=
"#xd21e9075" name="xd21e9075src">18</a> Two miles south of Madura is a
small hill of rock named Pasumalai. &ldquo;The name means cow hill, and
the legend in the Madura Sthala Pur&#257;na says that the Jains, being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>defeated in their attempt to destroy Madura by
means of the serpent which was turned into the N&#257;gamalai, resorted
to more magic, and evolved a demon in the form of an enormous cow. They
selected this particular shape for their demon, because they thought
that no one would dare kill so sacred an animal. Siva, however,
directed the bull which is his vehicle to increase vastly in size, and
go to meet the cow. The cow, seeing him, died of love, and was turned
into this hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the wall of the mantapam of the golden lotus tank
(p&#333;th&#257;mara&#299;) of the M&#299;nakshi temple at Madura is a
series of frescoes illustrating the persecution of the Jains. For the
following account thereof, I am indebted to Mr. K. V. Subramania Aiyar.
Sr&#299; Gn&#257;na Sammandha Sw&#257;mi, who was an avatar or
incarnation of Subramaniya, the son of Siva, was the foremost of the
sixty-three canonised saints of the Saivaite religion, and a famous
champion thereof. He was sent into the world by Siva to put down the
growing prevalence of the Jaina heresy, and to re-establish the Saivite
faith in Southern India. He entered on the execution of his earthly
mission at the age of three, when he was suckled with the milk of
spirituality by Parvati, Siva&rsquo;s consort. He manifested himself
first at the holy place Shiyali in the present Tanjore district to a
Br&#257;hman devotee named Sivapath&#257;bja Hirthaya and his wife, who
were afterwards reputed to be his parents. During the next thirteen
years, he composed about sixteen thousand th&#275;varam (psalms) in
praise of the presiding deity at the various temples which he visited,
and performed miracles. Wherever he went, he preached the Saiva
philosophy, and made converts. At this time, a certain Koon
(hunch-back) P&#257;ndyan was ruling over the Madura country, where, as
elsewhere, Jainism had asserted its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb436" href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>influence, and he and
all his subjects had become converts to the new faith. The queen and
the prime-minister, however, were secret adherents to the cult of Siva,
whose temple was deserted and closed. They secretly invited Sr&#299;
Gn&#257;na Sammandha to the capital, in the hope that he might help in
extirpating the followers of the obnoxious Jain religion. He
accordingly arrived with thousands of followers, and took up his abode
in a mutt or monastery on the north side of the Vaigai river. When the
Jain priests, who were eight thousand in number, found this out, they
set fire to his residence with a view to destroying him. His disciples,
however, extinguished the flames. The saint, resenting the complicity
of the king in the plot, willed that the fire should turn on him, and
burn him in the form of a virulent fever. All the endeavours of the
Jain priests to cure him with medicines and incantations failed. The
queen and the prime-minister impressed on the royal patient the virtues
of the Saiva saint, and procured his admission into the palace. When
Sammandha Sw&#257;mi offered to cure the king by simply throwing sacred
ashes on him, the Jain priests who were present contended that they
must still be given a chance. So it was mutually agreed between them
that each party should undertake to cure half the body of the patient.
The half allotted to Sammandha was at once cured, while the fever raged
with redoubled severity in the other half. The king accordingly
requested Sammandha to treat the rest of his body, and ordered the
Jaina priests to withdraw from his presence. The touch of
Sammandha&rsquo;s hand, when rubbing the sacred ashes over him, cured
not only the fever, but also the hunched back. The king now looked so
graceful that he was thenceforward called Sundara (beautiful)
P&#257;ndyan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>He was re-converted to Saivism, the doors of the
Siva temple were re-opened, and the worship of Siva therein was
restored. The Jain priests, not satisfied with their discomfiture,
offered to establish the merits of their religion in other ways. They
suggested that each party should throw the cadjan (palm-leaf) books
containing the doctrines of their respective religions into a big fire,
and that the party whose books were burnt to ashes should be considered
defeated. The saint acceding to the proposal, the books were thrown
into the fire, with the result that those flung by Sammandha were
uninjured, while no trace of the Jain books remained. Still not
satisfied, the Jains proposed that the religious books of both parties
should be cast into the flooded Vaigai river, and that the party whose
books travelled against the current should be regarded as victorious.
The Jains promised Sammandha that, if they failed in this trial, they
would become his slaves, and serve him in any manner he pleased. But
Sammandha replied: &ldquo;We have already got sixteen thousand
disciples to serve us. You have profaned the name of the supreme Siva,
and committed sacrilege by your aversion to the use of his emblems,
such as sacred ashes and beads. So your punishment should be
commensurate with your vile deeds.&rdquo; Confident of success, the
Jains offered to be impaled on stakes if they lost. The trial took
place, and the books of the Saivites travelled up stream. Sammandha
then gave the Jains a chance of escape by embracing the Saiva faith, to
which some of them became converts. The number thereof was so great
that the available supply of sacred ashes was exhausted. Such of the
Jains as remained unconverted were impaled on stakes resembling a
s&#363;la or trident. It may be noted that, in the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, Rishi M&#257;ndaviar is said to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>have
been impaled on a stake on a false charge of theft. And
R&#257;man&#363;ja, the Guru of the Vaishnavites, is also said to have
impaled heretics on stakes in the Mysore province. The events recorded
in the narrative of Sammandha and the Jains are gone through at five of
the twelve annual festivals at the Madura temple. On these occasions,
which are known as impaling festival days, an image representing a Jain
impaled on a stake is carried in procession. According to a tradition
the villages of M&#275;la K&#299;lavu and K&#299;l K&#299;lavu near
S&#333;lavand&#257;n are so named because the stakes (k&#299;lavu)
planted for the destruction of the Jains in the time of Tirugn&#257;na
extended so far from the town of Madura.</p>

<p><b>Jain Vaisya.</b>&mdash;The name assumed by a small colony of
&ldquo;Banians,&rdquo; who have settled in Native Cochin. They are
said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9098src" href="#xd21e9098" name=

Kannuthn&#257;d t&#257;luk of North Travancore, and believe that he who
proceeds thither a sufficiently large number of times obtains

<p><b>Jakkula.</b>&mdash;Described<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9105src"
href="#xd21e9105" name="xd21e9105src">20</a> as an inferior class of
prostitutes, mostly of the Balija caste; and as wizards and a dancing
and theatrical caste. At Tenali, in the Kistna district, it was
customary for each family to give up one girl for prostitution. She was
&ldquo;married&rdquo; to any chance comer for one night with the usual
ceremonies. Under the influence of social reform, the members of the
caste, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>in 1901, entered into a written agreement to
give up the practice. A family went back on this, so the head of the
caste prosecuted the family and the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; for disposing
of a minor for the purpose of prostitution. The records state that it
was resolved, in 1901, that they should not keep the females as girls,
but should marry them before they attain puberty. &ldquo;As the deeds
of the said girls not only brought discredit on all of us, but their
association gives our married women also an opportunity to contract bad
habits, and, as all of our castemen thought it good to give up
henceforth the custom of leaving girls unmarried now in vogue, all of
us convened a public meeting in the Tenali village, considered
carefully the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>, and entered into the
agreement herein mentioned. If any person among us fail to marry the
girls in the families before puberty, the managing members of the
families of the girls concerned should pay Rs. 500 to the three persons
whom we have selected as the headmen of our caste, as penalty for
acting in contravention of this agreement. If any person does not pay
the headmen of the caste the penalty, the headmen are authorised to
recover the amount through Court. We must abstain from taking meals,
living, or intermarriage with such of the families as do not now join
with us in this agreement, and continue to keep girls unmarried. We
must not take meals or intermarry with those that are now included in
this agreement, but who hereafter act in contravention of it. If any of
us act in contravention of the terms of the two last paragraphs, we
should pay a penalty of Rs. 50 to the headmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Jalagadugu.</b>&mdash;Defined, by Mr. C. P. Brown,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9120src" href="#xd21e9120" name=
"xd21e9120src">21</a> as &ldquo;a caste of gold-finders, who search for
gold in drains, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440"
name="pb440">440</a>]</span>and in the sweepings of goldsmiths&rsquo;
shops.&rdquo; A modest livelihood is also obtained, in some places, by
extracting gold from the bed of rivers or nullahs (water-courses). The
name is derived from jala, water, gadugu, wash. The equivalent
Jalak&#257;ra is recorded, in the Bellary Gazetteer, as a sub-division
of Kabb&#275;ra.</p>
<p>In the city of Madras, gold-washers are to be found working in the
foul side drains in front of jewellers&rsquo; shops. The Health Officer
to the Corporation informs me that he often chases them, and breaks
their pots for obstructing public drains in their hunt for pieces of
gold and other metals.</p>
<p>For the following note on the gold-washers of Madras, I am indebted
to Dr. K. T. Mathew: &ldquo;This industry is carried on in the city by
the Oddars, and was practically monopolised by them till a few years
back, when other castes, mostly of the lower orders, stepped in. The
Oddars now form a population of several thousands in the city, their
chief occupation being conservancy cooly work. The process of gold
washing is carried out by women at home, and by the aged and adults in
their spare hours. The ashes, sweepings, and refuse from the
goldsmiths&rsquo; shops are collected on payment of a sum ranging from
one rupee to ten rupees per mensem, and are brought in baskets to a
convenient place alongside their huts, where they are stored for a
variable time. The drain silts from streets where there are a large
number of jewellers&rsquo; shops are similarly collected, but, in this
case, the only payment to be made is a present to the Municipal peon.
The materials so collected are left undisturbed for a few days or
several months, and this storing away for a time is said to be
necessary to facilitate the extraction of the gold, as any immediate
attempt to wash the stuff results in great loss in the quantity

"pb441">441</a>]</span>obtained. From the heap as much as can be taken
on an ordinary spade is put into a boat-shaped tub open at one end,
placed close to the heap, and so arranged that the waste water from the
tub flows away from the heap behind, and collects in a shallow pool in
front. The water from the pool is collected in a small chatty (earthen
vessel), and poured over the heap in the tub, which is continually
stirred up with the other hand. All the lighter stuff in this way flows
out of the tub, and all the hard stones are every now and then picked
out and thrown away. This process goes on until about a couple of
handfuls of dark sand, etc., are left in the tub. To this a small
quantity of mercury is added, briskly rubbed for a minute or two, and
the process of washing goes on, considerable care being taken to see
that no particle of mercury escapes, until at last the mercury, with a
great many particles of metallic dust attached, is collected in a small
chatty&mdash;often a broken piece of a pot. The mercury, with the
metallic particles in it, is then well washed with clean water, and put
into a tiny bag formed of two layers of a piece of rag. The mass is
then gently pressed until all the mercury falls into a chatty below,
leaving a small flattened mass of dark substance in the bag, which is
carefully collected, and kept in another dry chatty. The washing
process is repeated until enough of the dark substance&mdash;about a
third of a teaspoonful&mdash;is collected. This substance is then mixed
with powdered common salt and brick-dust, put into a broken piece of a
pot, and covered with another piece. The whole is placed in a large
earthen vessel, with cow-dung cakes well packed above and below. A
blazing fire is soon produced, and kept up till the mass is melted.
This mass is carefully removed, and again melted with borax in a hole
made in a piece of good charcoal, by blowing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>through a reed or hollow bamboo, until the gold
separates from the mass. The fire is then suddenly quenched, and the
piece of gold is separated and removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>J&#257;l&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;The J&#257;l&#257;ris are Telugu
fishermen, palanquin-bearers, and cultivators in Ganjam and
Vizagapatam. The name, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao writes, is derived from
j&#257;la, a net. Some are fresh-water fishermen, while others fish
with a cast-net (visuru valalu) from the sea-shore, or on the open sea.
They bear the name Gangavamsamu, or people of Ganga, in the same way
that a division of the Kabb&#275;ra fishing caste is called
Gangimakkalu. In caste organisation, ceremonial, etc., the
J&#257;l&#257;ris coincide with the M&#299;las. They are called Noliyas
by the Oriyas of Ganjam. They have house-names like other Telugus, and
their females do not wear brass bangles, as low-caste Oriya women
do.</p>
<p>The J&#257;l&#257;ris have two endogamous divisions, called panrendu
kotla (twelve posts), and edu kotla (seven posts), in reference to the
number of posts for the booth. The former claim superiority over the
latter, on the ground that they are illegitimate J&#257;l&#257;ris, or
recently admitted into the caste.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the J&#257;l&#257;ris have a caste council
under the control of a headman called Pilla. In imitation of the
Oriyas, they have created an assistant headman called Dolob&#275;hara,
and they have the usual caste servant.</p>
<p>In their puberty, marriage and death ceremonies, they closely follow
the V&#257;das and Palles. The prohibitions regarding marriage are of
the Telugu form, but, like the Oriya castes, the J&#257;l&#257;ris
allow a widow to marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s younger brother.
The marriage ceremonies last for three days. On the first day, the
pandal (booth), with the usual milk-post, is erected. For <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>every marriage, representatives of the four
towns Peddapatnam, Vizagapatam, Bimlipatam, and Revalpatnam, should be
invited, and should be the first to receive p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel
leaves and areca nuts) after the pandal has been set up. Peddapatnam is
the first to be called out, and the respect may be shown to any person
from that town. The representatives of the other towns must belong to
particular septs, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="table">
<table class="verticalBorderInside xd21e486">
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellTop">Vizagapatam</td>
<td class="cellRight cellTop">Buguri sept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft">Revalpatnam</td>
<td class="cellRight">Jonna sept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">Bimlipatam</td>
<td class="cellRight cellBottom">Sundra sept.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The J&#257;l&#257;ris are unable to explain the significance of this
&ldquo;counting towns,&rdquo; as they call it. Possibly Peddapatnam was
their original home, from which particular septs emigrated to other
towns. On the second day of the marriage ceremonies, the tying of the
satham&#257;nam (marriage badge) takes place. The bridegroom, after
going in procession through the streets, enters the house at which the
marriage is to be celebrated. At the entrance, the maternal uncle of
the bride stands holding in his crossed hands two vessels, one of which
contains water, and the other water with jaggery (crude sugar)
dissolved in it. The bridegroom is expected to take hold of the vessel
containing the sweetened water before he enters, and is fined if he
fails to do so. When the bridegroom approaches the pandal, some married
women hold a bamboo pole between him and the pandal, and a new earthen
pot is carried thrice round the pole. While this is being done, the
bride joins the bridegroom, and the couple enter the pandal beneath a
cloth held up to form a canopy in front thereof. This ceremonial takes
place towards evening, as the marriage badge is tied on the
bride&rsquo;s neck during the night. An interesting feature in
connection with the procession is that a pole called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>digametlu (shoulder-pole), with two baskets tied
to the ends, is carried. In one of the baskets a number of sieves and
small baskets are placed, and in the other one or more cats. This
digametlu is always referred to by the V&#257;das when they are
questioned as to the difference between their marriage ceremonies and
those of the J&#257;l&#257;ris. Other castes laugh at this custom, and
it is consequently dying out.</p>
<p>The J&#257;l&#257;ris always marry young girls. One reason assigned
for this is &ldquo;the income to married young girls&rdquo; at the time
of the marriage ceremonies. Two or more married couples are invited to
remain at the house in which the marriage takes place, to help the
bridal couple in their toilette, and assist at the nalagu, evil eye
waving, and other rites. They are rewarded for their services with
presents. Another instance of infant marriage being the rule on account
of pecuniary gain is found among the Dikshitar Br&#257;hmans of
Chidambaram. Only married males have a voice in temple affairs, and
receive a share of the temple income. Consequently, boys are sometimes
married when they are seven or eight years old. At every
J&#257;l&#257;ri marriage, meals must be given to the castemen, a rupee
to the representatives of the patnams, twelve annas to the headman and
his assistant, and three rupees to the M&#257;las.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the J&#257;l&#257;ris have intip&#275;rus
(septs), which resemble those of the V&#257;das. Among them, Jonna and
Buguri are common. In their religious observances, the
J&#257;l&#257;ris closely follow the V&#257;das.</p>
<p>The Madras Museum possesses a collection of clay and wooden figures,
such as are worshipped by the fishing castes at Gopalp&#363;r, and
other places on the Ganjam coast. Concerning these, Mr. J. D&rsquo;A.
C. Reilly writes to me as follows. The specimens represent the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span>chief gods worshipped by the fishermen. The
Tahsildar of Berhamp&#363;r got them made by the potters and
carpenters, who usually make such figures for the Gopalp&#363;r
fishermen. I have found fishermen&rsquo;s shrines at several places.
Separate families appear to have separate shrines, some consisting of
large chatties (earthen pots), occasionally ornamented, and turned
upside down, with an opening on one side. Others are made of bricks and
chunam (lime). All that I have seen had their opening towards the sea.
Two classes of figures are placed in these shrines, viz., clay figures
of gods, which are worshipped before fishing expeditions, and when
there is danger from a particular disease which they prevent; and
wooden figures of deceased relations, which are quite as imaginative as
the clay figures. Figures of gods and relations are placed in the same
family shrine. There are hundreds of gods to choose from, and the
selection appears to be a matter of family taste and tradition. The
figures which I have sent were made by a potter at Venkatarayapalle,
and painted by a carpenter at Uppulapatti, both villages near
Gopalp&#363;r. The Tahsildar tells me that, when he was inspecting them
at the Gopalp&#363;r traveller&rsquo;s bungalow, sixty or seventy
<span class="corr" id="xd21e9175" title=
"Source: firshermen">fishermen</span> objected to their gods being
taken away. He pacified them by telling them that it was because the
Government had heard of their devotion to their gods that they wanted
to have some of them in Madras. The collection of clay figures includes
the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Bengali Babu.&mdash;Wears a hat, and rides on a black horse. He
blesses the fishermen, secures large hauls of fish for them, and guards
them against danger when out fishing.</p>
<p>S&#257;malamma.&mdash;Wears a red skirt and green coat and protects
the fishermen from fever. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href=
"#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span></p>
<p>R&#257;jamma, a female figure, with a sword in her right hand,
riding on a black elephant. She blesses barren women with children, and
favours her devotees with big catches when they go out fishing.</p>
<p>Yerenamma, riding on a white horse, with a sword in her right hand.
She protects fishermen from drowning, and from being caught by big
fish.</p>
<p>Bh&#257;g&#299;rathamma, riding on an elephant, and having eight or
twelve hands. She helps fishermen when fishing at night, and protects
them against cholera, dysentery, and other intestinal disorders.</p>
<p>N&#363;kalamma.&mdash;Wears a red jacket and green skirt, and
protects the fishing community against small-pox.</p>
<p>Orosondi Ammav&#257;ru.&mdash;Prevents the boats from being sunk or
damaged.</p>
<p>Bh&#257;gad&#275;vi.&mdash;Rides on a tiger, and protects the
community from cholera.</p>
<p>Veyyi Kannula Ammav&#257;ru, or the goddess of a thousand eyes,
represented by a pot pierced with holes, in which a gingelly
(<i>Sesamum</i>) oil light is burnt. She attends to the general welfare
of the fisher folk.</p>
<p><b>J&#257;li</b> (<i>Acacia arabica</i>).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of
Kurni.</p>
<p><b>Jalli.</b>&mdash;Jalli, meaning palm tassels put round the neck
and horns of bulls, occurs as an exogamous sept of J&#333;gi. The name
occurs further as a sub-division of Kevuto.</p>
<p><b>J&#257;mbava.</b>&mdash;A synonym of the M&#257;digas, who claim
descent from the rishi Audi J&#257;mbav&#257;du.</p>
<p><b>Jambu</b> (<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Odd&#275;.</p>
<p><b>J&#257;mbuvar</b> (a monkey king with a bear&rsquo;s
face).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kondaiyamkottai Maravan.</p>
<p><b>Jamkh&#257;nv&#257;la</b> (carpet-maker).&mdash;An occupational
name for Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans and Patv&#275;gars. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name="pb447">447</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Jammi</b> (<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of
Gollas, members of which may not use the tree. It is further a
g&#333;tra of Chembadis. Children of this caste who are named after the
caste god Gurappa or Gurun&#257;thadu are taken, when they are five,
seven, or nine years old, to a jammi tree, and shaved after it has been
worshipped with offerings of cooked food, etc. The jammi or sami tree
is regarded as sacred all over India. Some orthodox Hindus, when they
pass it, go round it, and salute it, repeating a Sanskrit verse to the
effect that &ldquo;the sami tree removes sins; it is the destroyer of
enemies; it was the bearer of the bows and arrows of Arjuna, and the
sight of it was very welcome to R&#257;ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Janappan.</b>&mdash;The Janappans, Mr. W. Francis
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9244src" href="#xd21e9244" name=
"xd21e9244src">22</a> &ldquo;were originally a section of the Balijas,
but they have now developed into a distinct caste. They seem to have
been called Janappan, because they manufactured gunny-bags of hemp
(janapa) fibre. In Tamil they are called Saluppa Chettis, Saluppan
being the Tamil form of Janappan. Some of them have taken to calling
themselves D&#275;s&#257;yis or D&#275;s&#257;dh&#299;patis (rulers of
countries), and say they are Balijas. They do not wear the sacred
thread. The caste usually speaks Telugu, but in Madura there is a
section, the women of which speak Tamil, and also are debarred from
taking part in religious ceremonies, and, therefore, apparently
belonged originally to some other caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Janappans of the North Arcot district<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9249src" href="#xd21e9249" name=
"xd21e9249src">23</a> Mr. H. A. Stuart states that Janappan is
&ldquo;the name of a caste, which engages in trade by hawking goods
about the towns and villages. Originally they were merely manufacturers
of gunny-bags out of hemp <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href=
"#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>(janapa, <i>Crotalaria
juncea</i>), and so obtained their name. But they are now met with as
D&#257;saris or religious beggars, sweetmeat-sellers, and hawkers of
English cloths and other goods. By the time they have obtained to the
last honourable profession, they assume to be Balijas. Telugu is their
vernacular, and Chetti their usual caste name. According to their own
tradition, they sprung from a y&#257;gam (sacrificial rite) made by
Brahma, and their remote ancestor thus produced was, they say, asked by
the merchants of the country to invent some means for carrying about
their wares. He obtained some seeds from the ashes of Brahma&rsquo;s
y&#257;gam, which he sowed, and the plant which sprang up was the
country hemp, which he manufactured into a gunny-bag. The Janapa
Chettis are enterprising men in their way, and are much employed at the
fairs at Gudiy&#257;ttam and other places as cattle-brokers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Saluppans say that they have twenty-four g&#333;tras, which are
divided into groups of sixteen and eight. Marriage is forbidden between
members of the same group, but permitted between members of the sixteen
and eight g&#333;tras. Among the names of the g&#333;tras, are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Vasava.</li>
<li>Vamme.</li>
<li>Mummudi.</li>
<li>Pilli Vankaravan.</li>
<li>Makkiduvan.</li>
<li>Thallelan.</li>
<li>Gendagiri.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Madalavan.</li>
<li>Piligara.</li>
<li>Mukkanda.</li>
<li>Vadiya.</li>
<li>Thonda.</li>
<li>K&#333;la.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The Janappans of the Telugu country also say that they have only
twenty-four g&#333;tras. Some of these are totemistic in character.
Thus, members of the Kappala (frog) g&#333;tra owe their name to a
tradition that on one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=
"#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span>occasion, when some of the family
were fishing, they caught a haul of big frogs instead of fish.
Consequently, members of this g&#333;tra do not injure frogs. Members
of the Thonda or Thonda Mah&#257; Rishi g&#333;tra abstain from using
the fruit or leaves of the thonda plant (<i>Cephalandra indica</i>).
The fruits of this plant are among the commonest of native vegetables.
In like manner, members of the Mukkanda sept may not use the fruit of
<i>Momordica Charantia</i>. Those of the Vamme g&#333;tra abstain from
eating the fish called bombadai, because, when some of their ancestors
went to fetch water in the marriage pot, they found a number of this
fish in the water collected in the pot. So, too, in the K&#333;la
g&#333;tra, the eating of the fish called k&#333;lasi is forbidden.</p>
<p>In their marriage customs, those who live in the Telugu country
follow the Telugu Pur&#257;nic form, while those who have settled in
the Tamil country have adopted some of the marriage rites thereof.
There are, however, some points of interest in their marriage
ceremonies. On the day fixed for the betrothal, those assembled wait
silently listening for the chirping of a lizard, which is an auspicious
sign. It is said that the match is broken off, if the chirping is not
heard. If the omen proves auspicious, a small bundle of nine to twelve
kinds of pulses and grain is given by the bridegroom&rsquo;s father to
the father of the bride. This is preserved, and examined several days
after the marriage. If the grain and pulses are in good condition, it
is a sign that the newly married couple will have a prosperous
career.</p>
<p>There are both Saivites and Vaishnavites among these people, and the
former predominate in the southern districts. Most of the Vaishnavites
are disciples of Bhatr&#257;zus. The Bhatr&#257;zu priest goes round
periodically, collecting his fees. Those among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>the
Saivites who are religiously inclined are disciples of Pand&#257;rams
of mutts (religious institutions). Those who have settled in the Salem
district seem to consider Damayanti and K&#257;m&#257;tchi as the caste
deities.</p>
<p>The manufacture of gunny-bags is still carried on by some members of
the caste, but they are mainly engaged in trade and agriculture. In the
city of Madras, the sale of various kinds of fruits is largely in the
hands of the Janappans.</p>
<p>S&#257;thu v&#257;ndlu, meaning a company of merchants or
travellers, occurs as a synonym of Janappan.</p>
<p>In the Mysore Census Report, 1901, Janappa is returned as a
sub-division of the G&#333;nigas, who are sack-weavers, and makers of
gunny-bags.</p>
<p><b>Jand&#257;yi</b> (flag).&mdash;An exogamous sept of

the Kurivik&#257;rans or K&#257;ttu Mar&#257;this.</p>
<p><b>Jangam.</b>&mdash;It is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
that &ldquo;strictly speaking, a Jangam is a priest to the religious
sect of Ling&#257;yats, but the term is frequently loosely applied to
any Ling&#257;yat, which accounts for the large numbers under this head
(102,121). Jangams proper are said to be of two classes,
Patt&#257;dik&#257;ris, who have a definite head-quarters, and
Charam&#363;rtis, who go from village to village, preaching the
principles of the Ling&#257;yat sect. Many Jangams are priests to
S&#363;dras who are not Ling&#257;yats, others are merely religious
beggars, and others of them go in for trade.&rdquo; In the Census
Report, 1891, it is further recorded that &ldquo;the full name is
Jangama Ling&#257;yat, meaning those who always worship a moveable
lingam, in contradistinction to the Sth&#257;vara (immoveable) lingam
of the temples. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451"
name="pb451">451</a>]</span>Only two of the sub-divisions returned are
numerically important, Gan&#257;yata and Sth&#257;vara. The
sub-division Sth&#257;vara is curious, for a Sth&#257;vara Jangam is a
contradistinction in terms. This sub-division is found only in the two
northern districts, and it is possible that the Jangam caste, as there
found, is different from the ordinary Jangam, for, in the Vizagapatam
District Manual, the Jangams are said to be tailors.&rdquo; In the
Telugu country Ling&#257;yats are called Jang&#257;lu.</p>
<p>The Ganta Jangams are so called, because they carry a metal bell
(ganta).</p>
<p>The Jangams are thus referred to by Pietro della Valle.<a class=

extravagant habits, and a kind of hood or cowl upon their heads of dyed
linen of that colour which is generally used amongst them, namely a
reddish brick colour, with many bracelets upon their arms and legs,
filled with something within that makes a jangling as they walk. I saw
many persons come to kiss their feet, and, whilst such persons were

"xd21e9361src">25</a> In 1805&ndash;1806, the Collector of Malabar
obtained, for the purpose of carrying out a scheme of assessment
approved by Government, a return from all proprietors of the seed,
produce, etc., of all their fields. This return is usually known as the
Janmi pym&#257;ish of 981 M.E. (Malabar era).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9365src" href="#xd21e9365" name="xd21e9365src">26</a></p>
<p>Writing to me concerning Malabar at the present day, a correspondent
states that &ldquo;in almost every t&#257;luk we have jungle tribes,
who call themselves the men of Janmis. In the old days, when forests
were sold, the inhabitants were actually entered in the contract as
part of the effects, as, in former times, the landlord sold the
<i>adscripti</i> or <i>ascripti gleb&aelig;</i> with the land. Now that
is not done. However, the relationship exists to the following extent,
according to what a Tahsildar (native magistrate) tells me. The
tribesmen roam about the forests at will, and each year select a place,
which has lain fallow for five years or more for all kinds of
cultivation. Sometimes they inform the Janmis that they have done so,
sometimes they do not. Then, at harvest time, the Janmi, or his agent,
goes up and takes his share of the produce. They never try to deceive
the Janmi. He is asked to settle their disputes, but these are rare.
They never go to law. The Janmi can call on them for labour, and they
give it willingly. If badly treated, as they have been at times by
encroaching plainsmen, they run off to another forest, and serve
another Janmi. At the &#332;nam festival they come with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>gifts for the Janmi, who stands them a feast.
The relation between the jungle folk and the Janmi shows the instinct
in a primitive people to have a lord. There seems to be no gain in
having a Janmi. His protection is not needed, and he is hardly ever
called in to interfere. If they refused to pay the Janmi his dues, he
would find it very hard to get them. Still they keep him.&rdquo; In the
middle of the last century, when planters first began to settle in the
Malabar Wyn&#257;d, they purchased the land from the Janmis with the
Paniyans living on it, who were practically slaves of the
landowners.</p>
<p>The hereditary rights and perquisites claimed, in their villages, by
the astrologer, carpenter, goldsmith, washerman, barber, etc., are
called Cherujanmam.</p>
<p><b>Janni.</b>&mdash;The name of the caste priests of

<p><b>J&#257;tapu.</b>&mdash;The J&#257;tapus are defined, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a civilised section of the
Khonds, who speak Khond on the hills and Telugu on the plains, and are
now practically a distinct caste. They consider themselves superior to
those Khonds who still eat beef and snakes, and have taken to some of
the ways of the castes of the plains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The
name J&#257;tapu is popularly believed to be an abbreviated form of
Konda J&#257;tapu Doralu, or lords of the Khond caste. To this caste

such, for example, as:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Th&#333;rika or Th&#333;yika, who revere the
th&#333;rika k&#333;di, a species of wild fowl.</p>
<p>K&#257;drika, who revere another species of fowl.</p>
<p>Mamdangi, who revere the bull or cow.</p>
<p>Add&#257;ku, who revere the add&#257;ku (<i>Bauhinia racemosa</i>),
which is used by low-country people for eating-platters.</p>
<p>Konda Gorr&#275;, who revere a certain breed of sheep.</p>
<p>Navalipitta, who revere the peacock.</p>
<p>Arika, who revere the arika (<i>Paspalum scrobiculatum</i>).</p>
</div>
<p>Other septs, recorded in the Census Report, 1901, are Koalaka
(arrow), Kutraki (wild goat), and Vinka (white ant, <i>Termes</i>).</p>
<p>Marriage is celebrated either before or after a girl reaches
puberty. A man may claim his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter as his
wife. The marriage ceremonies closely resemble those of the low-country
Telugu type. The bride-price, called v&#333;li, is a new cloth for the
bride&rsquo;s mother, rice, various kinds of grain, and liquor. The
bride is conducted to the house of the bridegroom, and a feast is held.
On the following morning, the k&#257;llag&#333;lla sambramam (toe-nail
cutting) ceremony takes place, and, later on, at an auspicious hour,
the wrist threads (kankanam) are tied on the wrists of the contracting
couple, and their hands joined together. They then bathe, and another
feast is held. The remarriage of widows is allowed, and a younger
brother may marry the widow of his elder brother. Divorce is permitted,
and divorc&eacute;es may remarry.</p>
<p>The dead are usually buried, but those who die from snake-bite are
said to be burnt. Death pollution lasts <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb455" href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>for three days,
during which the caste occupation of cultivating is not carried on. An
annual ceremony is performed by each family in honour of the dead. A
fowl or goat is killed, a portion of the day&rsquo;s food collected in
a plate, and placed on the roof of the house. Once in twenty years or
so, all the castemen join together, and buy a pig or cow, which is
sacrificed in honour of the ancestors.</p>
<p>The caste goddess is J&#257;kara D&#275;vata, who is propitiated
with sacrifices of pigs, sheep, and buffaloes. When the crop is
gathered in, the first fruits are offered to her, and then partaken
of.</p>
<p>The caste headman is called N&#257;yudu or S&#257;manthi, and he is
assisted by the Janni, or caste priest, who officiates at ceremonials,
and summons council meetings.</p>
<p>The caste titles are Dora, Naiko, and S&#257;manto.</p>
<p><b>J&#257;tik&#299;rtulu.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as a class of beggars in the Cuddapah district. The name
means those who praise the caste, and may have reference to the
Bhatr&#257;zus.</p>
<p><b>J&#257;ti Pillai</b> (children of the caste).&mdash;A general
name for beggars, who are attached to particular castes, from the
members of which they receive alms, and at whose ceremonies they take
part by carrying flags in processions, etc. It is their duty to uphold
the dignity of the caste by reciting the story of its origin, and
singing its praises. As examples of J&#257;ti Pillais, the following
may be cited:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail&#257;ri attached to K&#333;matis.</li>
<li>V&#299;ramushti attached to B&#275;ri Chettis and
K&#333;matis.</li>
<li>N&#333;kkan attached to Pallis.</li>
<li>M&#257;stiga attached to M&#257;digas.</li>

<p>It is recorded by Mr. M. Paupa Rao Naidu<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9462src" href="#xd21e9462" name="xd21e9462src">27</a> that some
Koravas, who go by the name of J&#257;tipalli Koravas, &ldquo;are
prevalent in the southern districts of the Madras Presidency, moving
always in gangs, and giving much trouble. Their women tattoo in return
for grain, money, or cloths, and help their men in getting acquainted
with the nature and contents of the houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Jaura.</b>&mdash;The Jauras are a small Oriya caste, closely
allied to the Khod&#363;ras, the members of which manufacture lac (jau)
bangles and other articles. Lac, it may be noted, is largely used in
India for the manufacture of bangles, rings, beads, and other trinkets
worn as ornaments by women of the poorer classes. Dhippo (light) and
mohiro (peacock) occur as common exogamous septs among the Jauras, and
are objects of reverence. The Jauras are mainly Saivites, and
S&#363;ramangala and Bimmala are the caste deities. Titles used by
members of the caste are Dans&#275;, S&#257;hu, Dh&#333;v, and
Mahap&#257;tro.</p>
<p><b>Javv&#257;di</b> (civet-cat).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
M&#275;dara.</p>
<p><b>Jelakuppa</b> (a fish).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba.</p>
<p><b>J&#275;n</b> (honey).&mdash;A sub-division of Kurumba.</p>
<p><b>Jenna.</b>&mdash;A title of Oriya castes, <i>e.g.</i>,
Bol&#257;si and K&#257;linji.</p>
<p><b>Jerrib&#333;tula</b> (centipedes).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Jetti.</b>&mdash;A Telugu caste of professional wrestlers and
gymnasts, who, in the Telugu districts, shampoo and rub in ointments to
cure nerve pains and other disorders. In Tanjore, though living in a
Tamil environment, they speak Telugu. They wear the sacred thread, and
consider themselves to be of superior caste, never descending to any
degrading work. During the days <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457"
href="#pb457" name="pb457">457</a>]</span>of the R&#257;jas of Tanjore,
they were employed in guarding the treasury and jewel rooms. But, since
the death of the late R&#257;ja, most of them have emigrated to Mysore
and other Native States, a few only remaining in Tanjore, and residing
in the fort.</p>
<p>The Jettis, in Mysore, are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9500src"
href="#xd21e9500" name="xd21e9500src">28</a> to have been sometimes
employed as executioners, and to have despatched their victim by a
twist of the neck.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9503src" href=
"#xd21e9503" name="xd21e9503src">29</a> Thus, in the last war against
T&#299;pu Sult&#257;n, General Matthews had his head wrung from his
body by the &ldquo;tiger fangs of the Jetties, a set of slaves trained
up to gratify their master with their infernal species of
dexterity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9506src" href="#xd21e9506"
name="xd21e9506src">30</a></p>
<p>They are still considered skilful in setting dislocated joints. In a
note regarding them in the early part of the last century, Wilks writes
as follows. &ldquo;These persons constitute a distinct caste, trained
from their infancy in daily exercises for the express purpose of
exhibitions; and perhaps the whole world does not produce more perfect
forms than those which are exhibited at these interesting but cruel
sports. The combatants, clad in a single garment of light
orange-coloured drawers extending half-way down the thigh, have their
right arm furnished with a weapon, which, for want of a more
appropriate term, we shall name a c&aelig;stus, although different from
the Roman instruments of that name. It is composed of buffalo horn,
fitted to the hand, and pointed with four knobs, resembling very sharp
knuckles, and corresponding to their situation, with a fifth of greater
prominence at the end nearest the little finger, and at right angles
with the other four. This instrument, properly placed, would enable a
man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>of ordinary strength to cleave open the head of
his adversary at a blow; but, the fingers being introduced through the
weapon, it is fastened across them at an equal distance between the
first and second lower joints, in a situation, it will be observed,
which does not admit of attempting a severe blow, without the risk of
dislocating the first joints of all the fingers. Thus armed, and
adorned with garlands of flowers, the successive pairs of combatants,
previously matched by the masters of the feast, are led into the arena;
their names and abodes are proclaimed; and, after making their
prostrations, first to the R&#257;ja seated on his ivory throne, and
then to the lattices behind which the ladies of the court are seated,
they proceed to the combat, first divesting themselves of the garlands,
and strewing the flowers gracefully over the arena. The combat is a
mixture of wrestling and boxing, if the latter may be so named. The
head is the exclusive object permitted to be struck. Before the end of
the contest, both of the combatants may frequently be observed
streaming with blood from the crown of the head down to the sand of the
arena. When victory seems to have declared itself, or the contest is
too severely maintained, the moderators in attendance on the R&#257;ja
make a signal for its cessation by throwing down turbans and robes, to
be presented to the combatants. The victor frequently goes off the
arena in four or five somersaults, to denote that he retires fresh from
the contest. The Jettis are divided into five classes, and the ordinary
price of victory is promotion to a higher class. There are distinct
rewards for the first class, and in their old age they are promoted to
be masters of the feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an account of sports held before T&#299;pu Sult&#257;n at
Seringapatam, James Scurry, who was one of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>prisoners, writes as follows.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9517src" href="#xd21e9517" name="xd21e9517src">31</a>
&ldquo;The getiees would be sent for, who always approached with their
masters at their head, and, after prostration, and making their grand
salams, touching the ground each time, they would be paired, one school
against another. They had on their right hands the wood-guamootie
(wajramushti) of four steel talons, which were fixed to each back joint
of their fingers, and had a terrific appearance when their fists were
closed. Their heads were close shaved, their bodies oiled, and they
wore only a pair of short drawers. On being matched, and the signal
given from Tippu, they begin the combat, always by throwing the
flowers, which they wear round their necks, in each other&rsquo;s
faces; watching an opportunity of striking with the right hand, on
which they wore this mischievous weapon which never failed lacerating
the flesh, and drawing blood most copiously. Some pairs would close
instantly, and no matter which was under, for the gripe was the whole;
they were in general taught to suit their holds to their
opponent&rsquo;s body, with every part of which, as far as concerned
them, they were well acquainted. If one got a hold against which his
antagonist could not guard, he would be the conqueror; they would
frequently break each other&rsquo;s legs and arms; and, if anyway
tardy, Tippu had means of infusing spirit into them, for there were
always two stout fellows behind each, with instruments in their hands
that would soon put them to work. They were obliged to fight as long as
Tippu pleased, unless completely crippled, and, if they behaved well,
they were generally rewarded with a turban and shawl, the quality being
according to their merit.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460"
href="#pb460" name="pb460">460</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Jettis of Mysore still have in their possession knuckle-dusters
of the type described above, and take part annually in matches during
the Dasara festival. A Jetti police constable, whom I saw at
Channapatna, had wrestled at Baroda, and at the court of Nepal, and
narrated to me with pride how a wrestler came from Madras to Bangalore,
and challenged any one to a match. A Jetti engaged to meet him in two
matches for Rs. 500 each, and, after going in for a short course of
training, walked round him in each encounter, and won the money
easily.</p>
<p>The Mysore Jettis are said to be called, in some places, Mushtigas.
And some are stated to use a jargon called Mallab&#257;sha.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9526src" href="#xd21e9526" name=

<p>Jetti further occurs as the name of an exogamous sept of the
Kavarais.</p>
<p><b>Jew.</b>&mdash;It has been said by a recent writer that
&ldquo;there is hardly a more curious, and in some respects one might
almost say a more weird sight than the Jew town, which lies beyond the
British Settlement at Cochin. Crossing over the lagoon from the
beautiful little island of Bolghotty, where the British Residency for
the Cochin State nestles in a bower of tropical vegetation, one lands
amidst cocoanut trees, opposite to one of the old palaces of the Cochin
R&#257;jahs, and, passing through a native bazaar crowded with
dark-skinned Malay&#257;lis, one turns off abruptly into a long narrow
street, where faces as white as those of any northern European race,
but Semitic in every feature, transport one suddenly in mind to the
Jewish quarter in Jerusalem, or rather perhaps to some <i>ghetto</i> in
a Polish city.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href=

<p>In the preparation of the following note, I have been much indebted
to the Cochin Census Report, 1901, and to a series of articles
published by Mr. Elkan N. Adler in the Jewish Chronicle.<a class=

<p>The circumstances under which, and the time when the Jews migrated
to the Malabar Coast, are wrapped in obscurity. They themselves are
able to give accounts of only isolated incidents, since whatever
records they had were lost at the destruction by the Portuguese of
their original settlement at Crangan&#363;r in 1565, and by the
destruction at a later period of such fragments as remained in their
possession in the struggle between the Portuguese and the Dutch, for
the Portuguese, suspecting that the Jews had helped the Dutch,
plundered their synagogue in Cochin.</p>
<p>It is recorded by the Dutch Governor Moens<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9548src" href="#xd21e9548" name="xd21e9548src">34</a> that
&ldquo;when Heer van Goens besieged Cochin, the Jews were quite eager
to provide the troops of the Dutch Company with victuals, and to afford
them all the assistance they could, hoping that they would enjoy under
this Company the greatest possible civil and religious liberty; but,
when the above-mentioned troops were compelled to leave this coast
before the end of the good monsoon, without having been able to take
Cochin, the Portuguese did not fail to make the Jews feel the terrible
consequences of their revenge. For, no sooner had the Dutch retreated,
than a detachment of soldiers was sent to the Jewish quarters, which
were pillaged and set fire to, whilst the inhabitants fled to the
high-lands, and returned only after Cochin was taken by the Dutch.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name=
"pb462">462</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jews, who still hold that the Malabar Israelites were in
possession of an old copy of the Sepher Thora, say that this copy, and
all other documents, got lost on the occasion when the Portuguese
destroyed the Jewish quarters, but this is not likely. For, whereas
they had time to save their most valuable property according to their
own testimony, and to take it to the mountains, they would not have
failed to take along with them these documents, which were to them of
inestimable value. For it is related that for a new copy of the
Pentateuch which at that time was in their synagogue they had so much
respect, and took such great care of it, that they even secured this
copy, and took it along, and (when they returned) carried it back with
great rejoicing, as it was done in olden times with the Ark of the
Covenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing in the eighteenth century, Captain Hamilton states<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9556src" href="#xd21e9556" name=
"xd21e9556src">35</a> that the Jews &ldquo;have a synagogue at Cochin,
not far from the King&rsquo;s Palace, in which are carefully kept their
Records, engraven on copper plates in Hebrew characters; and when any
of the characters decay, they are new cut, so that they can show their
own History from the Reign of Nebuchadnezzar to this present time. Myn
Heer Van Reeda, about the year 1695, had an Abstract of their History
translated from the Hebrew into low Dutch. They declare themselves to
be of the Tribe of Manasseh, a Part whereof was, by order of that
haughty Conqueror Nebuchadnezzar, carried to the easternmost Province
of his large Empire, which, it seems, reached as far as Cape Comerin,
which journey 200,000 of them travelled in three years from their
setting out of Babylon.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463"

<p>The elders of the White Jews of Cochin have in their possession a
charter on two copper plates in Vatteluttu character, &ldquo;the
original character which once prevailed over nearly all the Tamil
country and south-west coast, but which has long ceased to be used in
the former place, and, in the latter, is now only known in a later
form, used for drawing up documents by Hindu
R&#257;jas.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9562src" href=
"#xd21e9562" name="xd21e9562src">36</a> Concerning this copper-plate
charter, Mr. Adler writes that &ldquo;the white Jews say that they have
always held it; the black Jews contend that it was originally theirs.
The title-deed is quaint in many ways. It consists of three strips of
copper, one of which is blank, one etched on both sides, and the third
on one side only. The characters are made legible by being rubbed with
whitening. The copper plates have a round hole in the corner, through
which a string was passed to tie them together under seal, but the seal
is lost. They are now kept together by a thin and narrow copper band,
which just fits.&rdquo;</p>

follows:&mdash;</p>

trumpets, and little drums, and gates, and garlands over the streets,
and wreaths, and so on. We have granted unto him the land tax and
weight tax. Moreover, we have by these copper tablets sanctioned that,
when the houses of the city have to pay taxes to the palace, he need
not pay, and he shall enjoy other privileges like unto these. To Joseph
Rabb&#257;n, the prince of Anjavannam, and to his descendants, and to
his sons and daughters, and to the nephews and sons-in-law of his
daughters, in natural succession, so long as the world and moon exist,
Anjuvannam shall be his hereditary possession.&rdquo; It is suggested
by Dr. Oppert that Anjuvannam is identical with the fifth or foreign
caste.</p>
<p>Dr. E. Hultzsch, the latest authority on the subject of the copper
plates, gives the following translation:<a class="noteref" id=

(k&#333;), the glorious Bh&#257;skara Ravivarman, in the time during
which (he) was wielding the sceptre and ruling over many hundred
thousands of places, in the thirty-sixth year after the second year, on
the day on which (he) was pleased to stay at Muyirikk&#333;du. We have
given to &#298;ssuppu Irapp&#257;n (the village of) Anjuvannam,
together with the seventy-two proprietary rights (viz.), the tolls on
female elephants and other riding-animals, the revenue of Anjuvannam, a
lamp in day-time, a cloth spread (in front to walk on), a palanquin, a

Van&mdash;Talais&#275;ri&mdash;Gandan Kunrapp&#333;lan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The date of the inscription,&rdquo; Dr. Hultzsch adds,
&ldquo;was the thirty-sixth year opposite to the second year. As I have
shown on a previous occasion,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9645src" href=
"#xd21e9645" name="xd21e9645src">45</a> the meaning of this mysterious
phrase is probably &lsquo;the thirty-sixth year (of the king&rsquo;s
coronation, which took place) after the second year (of the
king&rsquo;s yauvar&#257;jya).&rsquo; The inscription records a grant
which the king made to &#298;ssuppu Irapp&#257;n, <i>i.e.</i>, Joseph
Rabb&#257;n. The occurrence of this Semitic name, combined with the two
facts that the plates are still with the Cochin Jews, and that the
latter possess a Hebrew translation of the document, proves that the
donee was a member of the ancient Jewish colony on the western coast.
The grant was made at Muriyikk&#333;du. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb467" href="#pb467" name="pb467">467</a>]</span>The Hebrew
translation identifies this place with Kodunnall&#363;r (Cranganore),
where the Jewish colonists resided, until the bad treatment which they
received at the hands of the Portuguese induced them to settle near
Cochin. The object of the grant was Anjuvannam. This word means
&lsquo;the five castes,&rsquo; and may have the designation of that
quarter of Cranganore, in which the five classes of
Artisans&mdash;Ain-Kamm&#257;lar, as they are called in the smaller
K&#333;ttayam grant&mdash;resided.&rdquo;</p>

Venkayya writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9655src" href=
"#xd21e9655" name="xd21e9655src">46</a> &ldquo;V&#299;ra-R&#257;ghava
conferred the title of Manigr&#257;mam on the merchant Iravikkorran.
Similarly Anjuvannam was bestowed by the Cochin plates on the Jew
Joseph Rabb&#257;n. The old Malay&#257;lam work Payyan&#363;r
Patt&#333;la, which Dr. Gundert considered the oldest specimen of
Malay&#257;lam composition, refers to Anjuvannam and Manigr&#257;mam.
The context in which the two names occur in this work implies that they
were trading institutions. In the K&#333;ttayam plates of Sth&#257;nu
Ravi, both Anjuvannam and Manigr&#257;mam are frequently mentioned.
Both of them were appointed along with the six hundred to be &lsquo;the
protectors&rsquo; of the grant. They were &lsquo;to preserve the
proceeds of the customs duty as they were collected day by day,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;to receive the landlord&rsquo;s portion of the rent on land.
If any injustice be done to them, they may withhold the customs and the
tax on balances, and remedy themselves the injury done to them. Should
they themselves commit a crime, they are themselves to have the
investigation of it.&rsquo; To Anjuvannam and Manigr&#257;mam was
granted the freehold of the lands of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>the town (of
Kollam?). From these extracts, and from the reference in the
Payyan&#363;r Patt&#333;la, it appears that Anjuvannam and
Manigr&#257;mam were semi-independent trading corporations. The epithet
Setti (merchant) given to Ravikkorran, the trade rights granted to him,
and the sources of revenue thrown open to him as head of
Manigr&#257;mam, confirm the view that the latter was a trading
corporation. There is nothing either in the Cochin grant, or in the
subjoined inscription to show that Anjuvannam and Manigr&#257;mam were,
as believed by Dr. Gundert and others, Jewish and Christian
principalities, respectively. It was supposed by Dr. Burnell that the
plate of V&#299;ra-R&#257;ghava <i>created</i> the principality of
Manigr&#257;mam, and the Cochin plates that of Anjuvannam, and that,
consequently, the existence of these two grants is presupposed by the
plates of Sth&#257;nu Ravi, which mention both Anjuvannam and
Manigr&#257;mam very often. The Cochin plates did not <i>create</i>
Anjuvannam, but conferred the honours and privileges connected
therewith to a Jew named Joseph Rabb&#257;n. Similarly, the rights and
honours associated with the other corporation, Manigr&#257;mam, was
bestowed at a later period on Ravikkorran. Therefore, Anjuvannam and
Manigr&#257;mam must have existed as institutions even before the
earliest of these three copper-plates was issued. It is just possible
that Ravikkorran was a Christian by religion. But his name and title
give no clue in this direction, and there is nothing Christian in the
document, except its possession by the present owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. Francis Day<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9668src" href="#xd21e9668" name="xd21e9668src">47</a> that
Governor Moens obtained three different translations of the plates,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>and gave as the most correct version one, in
which the following words occur:&mdash;&ldquo;We, Erawi, Wanwara,
Emperor of Malabar ... give this deed of rights to the good Joseph
Rabb&#257;n, that he may use the five colours, spread his religion
among the five castes.&rdquo; Mr. Burnell, however, notes that Dr.
Gundert has ascertained beyond doubt that Anjuvannan (literally five
colours) does not mean some privilege, but is the name of a place.</p>
<p>Concerning the copper-plates, Governor Moens writes thus. &ldquo;The
following translation is by the Jewish merchant Ezechiel Rabby, who was
an earnest explorer of anything that had any connection with his
nation. After this I will give another translation, which I got from
our second interpreter Barend Deventer, who was assisted by an old and
literary inhabitant of Malabar; and lastly I will add a third one,
which I obtained from our first interpreter Simon of Tongeren, assisted
by a heathen scribe of Calicut, in order thus not to allow the Jews to
be the judges in their own affair, but rather to enable the reader to
judge for himself in this doubtful matter. The first translation runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;By the help of God, who created the universe
and appoints the kings, and whom I honour, I, Erawi Wanwara, Emperor of
Malabar, grant in the 36th year of our happy reign at the court of
Moydiricotta&mdash;<i>alias</i> Cranganore&mdash;this Act of Privileges
to the Jew Josep Rabaan, viz., that he may make use of the five
colours, spread his religion among the five castes or dynasties, fire
salutes on all solemnities, ride on elephants and horses, hold stately
processions, make use of cries of honour, and in the day-time of
torches, different musical instruments, besides a big drum; that he may
walk on roads spread with white linen, hold tournaments with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>sticks, and sit under a stately curtain. These
privileges we give to Josep Rabaan and to the 72 households, provided
that the others of this nation must obey the orders of his and their
descendants so long as the sun shall shine on the earth. This Act is
granted in the presence of the Kings of Trevancore, Tekkenkore,
Baddenkenkore, Calicoilan, Aringut, Sammoryn, Palcatchery, and
Colastry; written by the secretary Calembi Kelapen in the year 3481
Kalijogam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The second translation differs in important statements
from the first, and would deserve more attention when neutral people of
Malabar could be found, who could testify to the credibility of the
same; but, notwithstanding the trouble I have taken to find such
persons, it has been hitherto in vain. The second translation runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the quiet and happy time of our reign, we, Erawi
Wanwara, imitator of (successor to ?) the sceptres, which for many
hundreds of thousands of years have reigned in justice and
righteousness, the glorious footsteps of whom we follow, now in the
second year of our reign, being the 36th year of our residence in the
town of Moydiricotta, grant hereby, on the obtained good testimony of
the great experience of Joseph Rabaan, that the said person is allowed
to wear long dresses of five colours, that he may use carriages
together with their appurtenances, and fans which are used by the
nobility. He shall have precedence to the five castes, be allowed to
burn day-lamps, to walk on spread out linen, to make use of palanquins,
Payeng umbrellas, large bent trumpets, drums, staff, and covered seats.
We give him charge over the 72 families and their temples, which are
found both here and elsewhere, and we renounce our rights on all taxes
and duties on both houses. He shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb471" href="#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>everywhere be allowed
to have lodgings. All these privileges and prerogatives, explained in
this charter, we grant to Joseph Rabaan head of the five castes, and to
his heirs, sons, daughters, children&rsquo;s children, the sons-in-law
married to the daughters, together with their descendants, as long as
the sun and moon shall shine; and we grant him also all power over the
five castes, as long as the names of their descendants shall last.
Witnesses hereof are the Head of the country of Wenaddo named Comaraten
Matandden; the head of the country of Wenaaodea named Codei
Cheri-canden; the Head of the country of Erala named Mana Bepalamaan;
the Head of the country Walonaddo named Trawaren Chaten; the Head of
the country Neduwalur named Codei Trawi; besides the first of the
lesser rulers of territories of the part of Cusupady Pawagan, namely
the heir of Murkom Chaten named Kelokandan; written by the secretary
named Gunawendda Wanasen Nayr, Kisapa Kelapa; signed by the
Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The third translation runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the name of the Most High God, who created the
whole world after His own pleasure, and maintains justice and
righteousness, I, Erwij Barman, raise my hands, and thank His Majesty
for his grace and blessing bestowed on my reign in Cranganore, when
residing in the fortress of Muricotta. I have granted for good reasons
to my minister Joseph Raban the following privileges; that he may wear
five coloured cloths, long dresses, and hang on the shoulders certain
cloths; that they may cheer together, make use of drums and
tambourines, burn lights during the day, spread cloths on the roads,
use palanquins, umbrellas, trumpet torches, burning torches, sit under
a throne (?), and <i>act as Head of all the Jews numbering seventy-two
houses</i>, who will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472"
name="pb472">472</a>]</span>have to pay him the tolls and taxes of the
country, no matter in what part of the country they are living; these
privileges I give to Joseph Raban and his descendants, be they males or
females, as long as any one of them is alive, and the sun and moon
shine on the earth; for this reason I have the same engraved on a
copper-plate as an everlasting remembrance. Witnesses are the Kings of
Travancore, Berkenkore, Sammorin, Arangolla, Palcatchery, Collastry,
and Corambenaddo; written by the secretary Kellapen.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The aforesaid copper-plate is written in the old
broken Northern Tamil language, but with different kinds of characters,
viz., Sanskrit and Tamil, and is now read and translated by a heathen
scribe named Callutil Atsja, who was born at Calicut, and who, during
the war, fled from that place, and stays at present on the hills.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;&lsquo;When these translations are compared
with one another, it will be observed at once that, in the first, the
privileges are granted to the Jew Joseph Rabban, and to the 72 Jewish
families, whereas, in the second, no trace is found of the word Jew;
and Joseph Rabban is, in the third, not called a Jew, but the minister
of the king, although he may be taken for a Jew from the context in the
course of the translation, for he is there appointed as <i>Head of all
the other Jews to the number of 72 houses</i>. It is equally certain
that the name of Rabaan is not exclusively proper to the Jews only.
Furthermore, the first and last translations grant the above-mentioned
privileges not only to Joseph Rabaan, but also to the 72 Jewish
families, whereas, according to the second translation, the same are
given to Joseph Rabaan, his family and offspring only. The second
translation, besides, does not at all mention the freedom granted, and
the consent to spread the Jewish religion among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb473" href="#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>the
five castes. Thus, it is obvious that these three translations do not
agree, that the first and third coincide more with each other than they
do with the second; that, for that reason, the first and last
translations deserve more to be believed than the second, which stands
alone; but that this, for that very reason, does not prove what it,
properly speaking, ought to prove, and, whereas I am not acquainted
with the Malabar language, I prefer to refrain from giving my opinion
on the subject. For hitherto I have been unable to come across, either
among the people of Malabar and Canara, or among the literary priests
and natives, any one who was clever enough to translate these old
characters for the fourth time, notwithstanding the fact that I had
sent a copy of these characters to the north and south of Cochin, in
order to have them deciphered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The witnesses who were present at the granting of this
charter differ also. The first and third translations, however, seem
also to concur more with each other than with the second one. But the
discrepancy of the second translation lies in this, that in it not the
personal names of the witnesses are recorded, but only their offices or
dignities, in which they officiated at that time; whereas the mistake
in the first and third translations consists herein, that the witnesses
are called kings, and more so of those places by which names these
places were called some time after and subsequently when times had
changed, and by which names they are still known. The second
translation, however, calls them merely heads of the countries, in the
same manner as they were known at the time of the Emperor, when these
heads were not as yet kings, because these heads bore the title of king
and ruler only after the well-known division of the Malabar Empire into
four chief kingdoms, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474"
name="pb474">474</a>]</span>and several smaller kingdoms and
principalities. It must be admitted, however, that the head of the
country of Cochin is, in the first and third translations, not
mentioned by that name, although the kingdom of Cochin is in reality
one of the four chief kingdoms of Malabar. I add this here for
elucidation, in order that one should not wonder, when reading this
charter, that inferior heads of countries and districts of the Malabar
Empire could be called kings, because the Empire being at that time not
as yet divided, they were not kings. It seems, therefore, to have been
a free translation, of which the translators of the first and third
translations have made use, and which has been pointed out in the
second translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The other statements of this charter, especially the
authority over the five castes, must be explained according to the
ancient times, customs, and habits of the people of Malabar, and need
not be taken into consideration here. Whether this charter has in
reality been granted to the Jews or not, it is certain that not at any
time has a Jew had great authority over his co-religionists, and still
less over the so-called five castes. Moreover, the property of the Jews
has never been free from taxes, notwithstanding the fact that the kings
to whom they were subject appointed as a rule as heads of the Jews men
of their own nationality. They were known by the name of Moodiliars,
who had no other authority than to dispose of small civil disputes, and
to impose small fines of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is, however, a peculiarity, which deserves to be
mentioned. Although, in the charter, some privileges are granted, which
were also given to other people, yet to no one was it ever permitted to
fire three salutes at the break of day, or on the day of a marriage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span>feast of one who entered upon the marriage
state, without a previous request and special permission. This was
always reserved, even to the present day, to the kings of Cochin only.
Yet up to now it was always allowed to the Jews without asking first.
And it is known that the native kings do not easily allow another to
share in outward ceremonies, which they reserve for themselves. If,
therefore, the Jews would have arrogated to themselves this privilege
without high authority, the kings of Cochin would put a stop to this
privilege of this nation, whose residences are situated next to the
Cochin palace, but for this reason, I suppose, dare not do
so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Various authorities have attempted to fix approximately the date of
the copper-plate charter. Mr. Burnell gives 700 A.D. as its probable
date. The Rev. G. Milne Rae, accepting the date as fixed by Mr.
Burnell, argues that the Jews must have received the grant a few
generations after the settlement, and draws the conclusion that they
might have settled in the country some time about the sixth century
A.D. Dr. J. Wilson, in a lecture<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9722src"
href="#xd21e9722" name="xd21e9722src">48</a> on the Beni-Israels of
Bombay, adopts the sixth century of the Christian era as the probable
date of the arrival of the Beni-Israels in Bombay, about which time
also, he is inclined to think, the Cochin Jews came to India, for their
first copper-plate charter seems to belong to this period. There is no
tradition among the Jews of Cochin that they and the Beni-Israels
emigrated to the shores of India from the same spot or at the same
time, and the absence of any social intercourse between the
Beni-Israels and the Cochin Jews seems to go against this theory. In
one of the translations of the charter obtained by the Dutch
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>Governor Moens, the following words appear:
&ldquo;Written by the Secretary Calembi Kelapoor, in the year 3481 of
the Kali-yuga (<i>i.e.</i>, 379 A.D.).&rdquo; This date does not
appear, however, in the translations of Gundert, Ellis, Burnell and
Oppert. The charter was given in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of
the donor Bhaskara Ravi Varma. And, as all, except the last of the
foreign Viceroys of K&#275;rala, are said to have been elected for
twelve years only, Cherum&#257;n Perum&#257;l, reputed to be the last
of Perum&#257;ls, who under exceptional circumstances had his term
extended, according to Malabar tradition, to thirty-six years, may be
identical with Bhaskara Ravi Varma, who, Mr. Day says, reigned till 378
A.D. Mr. C. M. Whish gives a still earlier date, for he fixes 231 A.D.
as the probable date of the grant. In connection with the claim to the
antiquity of the settlement of the Jews in Malabar, it is set forth in
the Cochin Census Report that they &ldquo;are supposed to have first
come in contact with a Dravidian people as early as the time of Solomon
about B.C. 1000, for &lsquo;philology proves that the precious cargoes
of Solomon&rsquo;s merchant ships came from the ancient coast of
Malabar.&rsquo; It is possible that such visits were frequent enough in
the years that followed. But the actual settlement of the Jews on the
Malabar coast might not have taken place until long afterwards. Mr.
Logan, in the Manual of Malabar, writes that &lsquo;the Jews have
traditions, which carry back their arrival on the coast to the time of
their escape from servitude under Cyrus in the sixth century
B.C.,&rsquo; and the same fact is referred to by Sir W. Hunter in his
&lsquo;History of British India.&rsquo; This eminent historian, in his
&lsquo;Indian Empire&rsquo; speaks of Jewish settlements in Malabar
long before the second century A.D. A Roman merchant ship, that sailed
regularly from Myos Hormuz <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href=
"#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span>on the Red Sea to Arabia, Ceylon,
and Malabar, is reported to have found a Jewish colony in Malabar in
the second century A.D. In regard to the settlement of the Jews in
Malabar, Mr. Whish observes that &lsquo;the Jews themselves say that
Mar Thomas, the apostle, arrived in India in the year of our Lord 52,
and themselves, the Jews, in the year 69.&rsquo; In view of the
commercial intercourse between the Jews and the people of the Malabar
coast long before the Christian era, it seems highly probable that
Christianity but followed in the wake of Judaism. The above facts seem
to justify the conclusion that the Jews must have settled in Malabar at
least as early as the first century A.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Cochin the Jews enjoyed full privileges of citizenship, and were
able to preserve the best part of their religious and civil liberty,
and to remain here for centuries unseen, unknown, and unsearched by
their persecutors. But, in the sixteenth century, they fell victims by
turns to the oppression of fanatical Moors and over-zealous Christians.
&ldquo;In 1524, the Mahomedans made an onslaught on the Crangan&#363;r
Jews, slew a great number, and drove out the rest to a village to the
east; but, when they attacked the Christians, the Nayars of the place
retaliated, and in turn drove all the Mahomedans out of Crangan&#363;r.
The Portuguese enlarged and strengthened their Crangan&#363;r fort, and
compelled the Jews finally to desert their ancient settlement of
Anjuvannam.&rdquo; Thus, with the appearance of a powerful Christian
nation on the scene, the Jews experienced the terrors of a new exile
and a new dispersion, the desolation of Crangan&#363;r being likened by
them to the desolation of Jerusalem in miniature. Some of them were
driven to villages adjoining their ruined principality, while others
seem to have taken shelter in Cochin and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb478" href="#pb478" name="pb478">478</a>]</span>Ern&#257;kulam.
&ldquo;Cranganore,&rdquo; Mr. Adler writes, &ldquo;was captured by the
Mahomedan Sheikh or Zamorin in 1524, and razed to the ground. The Rajah
Daniel seems to have previously sent his brother David to Europe to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e9736" title=
"Source: negociate">negotiate</span> with the Pope and the Portuguese
for an offensive and defensive alliance against the Zamorin. Anyhow, a
mysterious stranger, who called himself David Rubbeni, appeared in Rome
in March, 1524, and, producing credentials from the Portuguese
authorities in India and Egypt, was received with much honour by the
Pope, King John of Portugal, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth in turn.
After some years he fell a victim to the inquisition, but his failure
and non-return to India are more easily explained by the fact that he
was too late, and that the State he represented was no longer existent,
than by the cheap assumption of all our historians, including Graetz,
that he was an impostor with a cock-and-bull story. Whether the famous
diary of David Rubbeni is genuine or not is less certain. But I have
elsewhere sought to re-establish this long-discredited ambassador, and
here limit myself to drawing attention to his name, which seems to have
been David Rabbani. To this day David is one of the commonest names
among the Cochin Jews, as well as the B&rsquo;nei Israel, and Rabbani
is the name of the ruling family under the copper grant. Its alteration
into Rubeni was due to sixteenth century interest in the lost ten
tribes, and a consequent desire of identifying the Royal family as
sprung from Reuben, the first-born of Israel. Reuben, too, is a
favourite name among the B&rsquo;nei Israel. With the destruction of
their capital, the Jews left and migrated, though to no great distance.
Within 20 miles south of Cranganore are four other places, all on the
Cochin back-water, where the Black <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479"
href="#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>Jews still have synagogues.
Par&#363;r, Chennan Mangalam, and M&#257;la have each one synagogue,
Ern&#257;kulam has two, and Cochin three, of which one belongs to the
White Jews. The Par&#363;r Jews have also the ruins of another
synagogue marked by a Ner Tamid, which they say existed 400 years ago,
when there were eighteen Bot&#275; Midrash (schools) and 500 Jewish
houses. This tradition further confirms the importance of Cranganore
before 1524. With the advent of the Dutch, better times ensued for the
Jews. The Dutch were bitter foes of the Portuguese and their
inquisition, and friends of their enemies. Naturally the Jews were on
the side of the Dutch, and, as naturally, had to suffer for their
temerity. In 1662 the Dutch attacked the R&#257;nee&rsquo;s palace at
Matt&#257;ncheri and besieged the adjoining town of Cochin, but had to
retire before Portuguese reinforcements. The Portuguese therefore burnt
the synagogue adjoining the palace, because they suspected the Jews, no
doubt with justice, of having favoured the Dutch. In the following
year, however, &lsquo;the Dutch renewed their attack on Cochin, this
time with complete success. The port and town fell into their hands,
and with it fell the Portuguese power in India. By a series of
treaties, Cochin and Holland became close allies, and the Dutch
settlement became firmly established in Cochin.&rsquo; The Dutch helped
the White Jews to rebuild their synagogue. The Dutch clock is still the
pride of Cochin Jewry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is well known that the Cochin Jews are generally divided into two
classes, the White and the Black. Writing in the early part of the
eighteenth century,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9744src" href=
"#xd21e9744" name="xd21e9744src">49</a> Bald&aelig;us states that
&ldquo;in and about the City of Cochin, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb480" href="#pb480" name="pb480">480</a>]</span>lived formerly some
Jews, who even now have a synagogue allow&rsquo;d them without the
Fortifications; they are neither White nor Brown, but quite black. The
Portuguese Histories mention that at a certain time certain blasphemous
papers against our Saviour, with some severe reflections against the
Jesuit Gonsalvus Pereira (who afterwards suffer&rsquo;d Martyrdom at
Monopatapa) being found in a box set in the Great Church for the
gathering of Alms; and the same being supposed to be laid there by some
European Jews, who now and then used to resort thither privately, this
gave occasion to introduce the Inquisition into Goa.&rdquo; It is noted
by the Rev. J. H. Lord<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9749src" href=
"#xd21e9749" name="xd21e9749src">50</a> that &ldquo;Jacob Saphir, a
Jewish traveller, who visited his co-religionists in Cochin in recent
years, having described some of the Jews resident there as black,
hastens to tone down his words, and adds, they are not black like the
raven, or as the Nubians, but only as the appearance of copper. But
Hagim Jacob Ha Cohen, another modern Jewish traveller, chastizing the
latter for calling them black at all, declares that he will write of
this class everywhere as the non-white, and never anywhere (God
forbid!) as the Black.&rdquo; The Black Jews claim to have been the
earliest settlers, while the White Jews came later. But the latter
assert that the former are pure natives converted to the Jewish faith.
These two difficult, yet important, issues of priority of settlement
and purity of race have divided antiquarians and historians quite as
much as they have estranged the two classes of Jews themselves from one
another. According to the Rev. C. Buchanan,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9752src" href="#xd21e9752" name="xd21e9752src">51</a> the White
Jews dwelling in Jews&rsquo; town in Matt&#257;ncheri are later
settlers than the Black Jews. They had only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name="pb481">481</a>]</span>the
Bible written on parchment, and of modern appearance, in their
synagogue, but he managed to get from the Black Jews much older
manuscripts written on parchment, goat&rsquo;s skin, and cotton paper.
He says that &ldquo;it is only necessary to look at their countenances
to be satisfied that their ancestors must have arrived in India many
years before the White Jews. Their Hindu complexion, and their very
imperfect resemblance to the European Jews, indicate that they had been
detached from the parent stocks in Judea many ages before the Jews in
the West, and that there have been marriages with families not
Israelitish.&rdquo; The Rev. J. Hough observes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9758src" href="#xd21e9758" name="xd21e9758src">52</a> that the
Black Jews &ldquo;appear so much like the natives of India, that it is
difficult at first sight to distinguish them from the Hindu. By a
little closer observation, however, the Jewish contour of their
countenances cannot be mistaken.&rdquo; In the lecture already referred
to, Dr. Wilson states that &ldquo;their family names, such as David
Castile (David the Castilian) go to prove that they (the White Jews)
are descended of the Jews of Spain, probably of those driven from that
country in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, and of German and
Egyptian Jews. The real ancient Jews of Cochin are the Black
Jews&rsquo; descendants, we believe, of Judea-Arabians and Indian
proselytes. Some rather obscure references to the Jews of Cochin and
Quilon are made by Benjamin of Tudela, who returned to Spain from his
eastern voyage in 1173. He found no White Jews in India. Speaking of
those in the pepper country near Chulam (Quilon), he says that all the
cities and countries inhabited by these people contain only about 100
Jews (members of the synagogue), who are of black <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=
"pb482">482</a>]</span>colour as well as the other inhabitants.&rdquo;
Referring to Jan Linschoten&rsquo;s &lsquo;Itinerary,&rsquo; published
in Holland in 1596, Mr. Adler observes that &ldquo;the Jews who
interested our traveller were the &lsquo;rich merchants and of the king
of Cochin&rsquo;s nearest counsellers, who are most white of colour
like men of Europe, and have many fair women. There are many of them
that came of the country Palestine and Jerusalem thither, and spoke
over all the exchange verie perfect and good Spanish.&rsquo; This
directly confirms the view that the White Jews were new comers from
foreign lands. Their knowledge of Spanish is now quite a thing of the
past, but it proves that they were Sephardim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In regard to the claim of the White Jews to being the only genuine
Jews, it may be of interest to record the opinion of a Jew, Rabbi David
D&rsquo;Beth Hithel, who travelled in Cochin in 1832. He says that
&ldquo;the White Jews say of them (the Black Jews) that they are
descendants of numerous slaves who were purchased and converted to
Judaism, set free and carefully instructed by a rich White Jew some
centuries ago. At his cost, they say, were all their old synagogues
erected. The Black Jews believe themselves to be the descendants of the
first captivity, who were brought to India, and did not return with the
Israelites who built the second temple. This account I am inclined to
believe correct. Though called Black Jews&mdash;they are of somewhat
darker complexion than the White Jews&mdash;yet they are not of the
colour of the natives of the country, or of persons descended from
Indian slaves.&rdquo; This passage bears reference to a tradition
current among the Black Jews that they are the descendants of the Jews
who were driven out of the land of Israel thirteen years before the
destruction of the first temple built by Solomon. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name="pb483">483</a>]</span>are
said to have first come to Calicut, whence they emigrated to
Crangan&#363;r.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Jews,&rdquo; Mr. Adler writes, &ldquo;claiming that
they, and they alone, are the true descendants of the aboriginal Jews
of Crangan&#363;r, retain the copper tablets in their possession, and
boast that, about the beginning of the seventeenth century, the
R&#257;jah of Cochin invested the head of the Hallegua family with the
hereditary title of Mudaliar or Noble [and a wand with a silver knob as
a sign of his dignity], with the power of punishing certain crimes. The
males of that family still bear the title, but their feudal rights have
been abrogated. Nowadays the number of White Jews has dwindled to less
than 200, so that it was easy to procure a list of all their names.
From the foreign origin of their surnames (Kindel, Ashkenazi, Mizrahi,
Koder, Roby, Sassoon), as well as for other reasons, it seems certain
that the White Jews are late comers, who did not settle in India till
after the destruction of Crangan&#363;r. They were traders, who came to
Cochin; they prospered under the rule of the Dutch, and built their
synagogue and quarter after the Black Jews were already established
there. Though, now, they hold themselves jealously aloof from the Black
Jews, they were at first quite intimate and friendly. The Indian
environment has had the opposite effect to that which England has had
upon our Ashkenazim and our no longer exclusive Sephardim. In India
caste is varna, which means colour, and their difference in colour has
produced caste distinctions among the Indian Jews. But, although the
White Jews are fair, some of them are certainly not quite white, nor
are the Black Jews quite black. Some of the &lsquo;Black&rsquo; Jews
are hardly distinguishable from their &lsquo;White&rsquo; brethren.
Their customs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=
"pb484">484</a>]</span>ritual, and religious observances are the same.
Their synagogues are so alike that it needs some keenness of eyesight
to detect that two pictures are not of the identical building. The only
great (?) difference is that the White Jews have theirs tiled with rare
old blue tiles, over which newspaper correspondents wax eloquent. They
say the tiles are old Dutch, but really they are genuine Chinese [blue
and white Canton China],<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9771src" href=
"#xd21e9771" name="xd21e9771src">53</a> whereby hangs a tale. The
synagogue was built nearly 200 years ago in a corner of the
R&#257;jah&rsquo;s palace-yard. At that time, the Dutch were in
possession of what is now British Cochin, and they were the only people
trading with China. The R&#257;jah, through his allies the Dutch, had
imported a large quantity of the best China tiles to pave his Darbar
hall, but the Jews, says Mr. Thurston, thought they would just do for
the synagogue they were building, so they told the R&#257;jah that he
could not possibly use them, inasmuch as bullock&rsquo;s blood had been
employed in their manufacture. His Highness, much perturbed at the
indignity to so sacred an animal, bade them take the tiles away, and
never let him see them again. Hence their presence in the synagogue.
The other synagogue has tiles also, but they are of gleaming
white.&rdquo; The synagogues, it may be added, are square whitewashed
buildings, surmounted by a bell-tower. It is said that the Kadyabagan
synagogue of the Black Jews is admitted by the White Jews to be the
oldest at present existing, having been built in the 12th century.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Governor Moens that &ldquo;in the Jewish quarters
(situated) next to the palace of the king of Cochin at Cochin de Sima
there are two synagogues, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href=
"#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>viz., one for the White Jews, and
the other for the Black Jews. The latter have readers of their own
tribe, who hold the services, but, when a White Rabbi comes to their
synagogue, the honour of conducting the service must be given to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dates,&rdquo; the Rev. J. H. Lord writes, &ldquo;of the
synagogues of the Black Jews altogether antedate those of the White.
Thus, the date on the mural slab of the now disused and dilapidated
Cochin Angadi synagogue is A.D. 1344 = 563 years ago. That of the
Kadavambagom synagogue in Cochin is A.D. 1639, or = 268 years ago. That
of the Cochin Theckumbagom synagogue is A.D. 1586, or = 321 years ago;
while that of the synagogue of the White Jews is A.D. 1666 or = 241
years ago. Hence the institutions of the Black Jews are the more
ancient. The tomb-stone dates of the Black Jews are also far more
ancient than those of the White Jews. The earliest date of any
tomb-stone of the Black Jews is six hundred years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is further noted by the Rev. J. H. Lord that &ldquo;the Black
Jews are still the ones who make use of the privileges granted in the
copper-plate charter. They still carry a silk umbrella, and lamps lit
at day-time, when proceeding to their synagogue on the 8th day after
birth of sons. They spread a cloth on the ground, and place ornaments
of leaves across the road on occasions when their brides and
bridegrooms go to get married, and use then cadanans (mortars which are
charged with gunpowder, and fired), and trumpets. After the wedding is
over, four silk sunshades, each supported on four poles, are borne,
with lamps burning in front, as the bridal party goes home. The Black
Jews say that the White Jews use none of these, and never have done so.
The White Jews aver that they were accustomed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486</a>]</span>formerly to use such privileges, but have
discontinued them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is record of disputes between the White and Black Jews for as
early a time as that of the Dutch settlement, or even earlier. Jealousy
and strife between the two sections on matters of intermarriage and
equal privileges seem to have existed even during the time of the
Portuguese. Canter Visscher, in his &lsquo;Letters from
Malabar,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9786src" href="#xd21e9786"
name="xd21e9786src">54</a> refers to these party feelings. &ldquo;The
blacks,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;have a dark coloured Rabbi, who must
stand back if a white one enters, and must resign to him the honour of
performing the divine service in the synagogue. On the other hand, when
the black Rabbis enter the synagogue of Whites, they must only be
hearers. There has lately been a great dispute between the two races;
the Black wishing to compel the White Jewesses to keep their heads
uncovered, like their own women, and trying to persuade the R&#257;jah
to enforce such a rule. The dispute ended, however, with permission
given to every one, both men and women, to wear what they
chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than once, Jewish Rabbis have been appealed to on the subject
of racial purity, and they have on all occasions upheld the claims of a
section of the Black Jews to being Jews, and the White Jews have as
often repudiated such decisions, and questioned their validity. The
weight of authority, and the evidence of local facts, seem to militate
against the contention of the White Jews that the Black Jews do not
belong to the Israelitish community, but are the descendants of
emancipated slaves and half castes. The White Jews appear to have
maintained the purity of their race by declining <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>intermarriage with the Black Jews. It must be
admitted that, in the earlier centuries, the original settlers
purchased numerous slaves, who have since then followed the religion of
their masters. It is recorded by Stavorinus<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9793src" href="#xd21e9793" name="xd21e9793src">55</a> that
&ldquo;when these Jews purchase a slave, they immediately manumit him;
they circumcise him and receive him as their fellow Israelite, and
never treat him as a slave.&rdquo; It is noted by Canter
Visscher<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9797src" href="#xd21e9797" name=
"xd21e9797src">56</a> that &ldquo;the Jews make no objection to selling
their slaves who are not of their own religion to other nations,
obliging them, however, when sold, to abandon the use of the Jewish
cap, which they had before worn on their heads. But slaves, male or
female, once fully admitted into their religion by the performance of
the customary rites, can never be sold to a stranger.&rdquo; The Jews
are said to have had former fugitive connections with the women of
these converts, and brought into existence a mixed race of Dravidians
and Semitics. It would be uncharitable to infer from this that all the
Black Jews are the descendants of converted slaves or half-castes, as
it would be unreasonable to suppose that all of them are the
descendants of the original settlers. It is noted by Mr. Adler that
&ldquo;the Rev. J. H. Lord quotes an interesting pronouncement on the
racial purity of the Black Jews of Malabar made by Haham Bashi of
Jerusalem in 1892. The Rabbi is said to have referred to the Maharikash
(R. Jacob Castro, of Alexandria), whose responsum in 1610 confirmed the
&lsquo;Jichus&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Mejuchasim&rsquo; and decided
likewise. He is even said to have allowed one of his relatives to marry
a Brown Jew! Nowadays, the White Jews hold aloof from the larger
community, black or brown, and profess to be of another caste
altogether. But one of the most intelligent of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=
"pb488">488</a>]</span>their number, who took us round the synagogues,
professed to think such exclusiveness exaggerated and unfair, and
admitted that their own grandfathers had lived with Black Jewesses in a
more or less binding marital relation, and it is abundantly clear that,
till recently, the Black and White Jews were quite friendly, and the
very fact of the White Jews holding the title-deeds merely proves that
they were trusted by the true owners to keep them for safe custody, as
they were richer and possessed safes. In an article in the
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</span>,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9807src" href="#xd21e9807" name=
"xd21e9807src">57</a> Pierre Loti, writing of the Black Jews, says that
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">le rabbin me fait d&rsquo;ameres
dol&eacute;ances sur la fiert&eacute; des rivaux de la rue proche, qui
ne veulent jamais consentir &agrave; contracter marriage, ni m&ecirc;me
&agrave; frayer avec ses paroissiens. Et, pour comble, me dit-il, le
grand rabbin de J&eacute;rusalem, &agrave; qui on avait adress&eacute;
une plainte collective, le priant d&rsquo;intervenir, s&rsquo;est
content&eacute; d&rsquo;&eacute;mettre, en r&eacute;ponse, cette
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralit&eacute; plut&ocirc;t offensante: Pour nicher
ensemble, il faut &ecirc;tre des moineaux de m&ecirc;me
plumage.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recent years, a distinction appears to have grown up among the
Black Jews, so that they now want to be distinguished as Brown Jews and
Black Jews, the former claiming to be Meyookhasim or genuine Jews. In
this connection, Mr. Adler writes that &ldquo;the Black Jews are
themselves divided into two classes, the Black Jews proper, who are
darker, and have no surnames, and the noble, who have family names and
legitimate descent, and claim to be the true descendants of the
Crangan&#363;r or Singili Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Jews are generally known by the name of Parad&#275;sis
(foreigners). This designation is found in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name="pb489">489</a>]</span>some
of the Sirkar (State) accounts, and also in a few Theetoorams or Royal
writs granted to them. It is argued that they must have been so called
at first to distinguish them from the more ancient Israelites. The
existence for centuries of three small colonies of Black Jews at
Ch&#275;nnamangalam and M&#257;la in the Cochin State, and Par&#363;r
in Travancore, at a distance of five or six miles from Crangan&#363;r,
shows that they must have sought refuge in those places on being hard
pressed by the Moors and the Portuguese. There are no White Jews in any
of these stations, nor can they point to any vested interests in the
tracts about Crangan&#363;r, the most ancient Jewish settlement in the
State.</p>
<p>The Jews wear a long tunic of rich colour, a waistcoat buttoned up
to the neck, and full white trousers. They go about wearing a skull
cap, and put on a turban when they go to the synagogue. The Black Jews
dress more or less like the native Mahomedans. Many of them put on
shirts, and have skull caps like the J&#333;naka M&#257;ppilas. They
generally wear coloured cloths. The Jews invariably use wooden sandals.
These, and their locks brought down in front of the ears, distinguish
them from other sections of the population. The Jewesses always wear
coloured cloths. Hebrew is still the liturgical language, and is
studied as a classic by a few, but the home language is Malay&#257;lam.
The White Jews celebrate their marriages on Sundays, but the Black Jews
still retain the ancient custom of celebrating them on Tuesdays after
sunset. Though polygamy is not prohibited, monogamy is the rule. The
males generally marry at the age of 20, while the marriageable age for
girls is 14 or 15. Marriages are generally celebrated on a grand scale.
The festivities continue for seven days <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb490" href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span>in the case of the
White Jews, and for fifteen days among the Black Jews, who still make
use of some of the ancient privileges granted by the charter of
Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l. The Jews of all sections have adopted
a few Hindu customs. Thus, before going to the synagogue for marriage,
a t&#257;li (marriage badge) is tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck by
some near female relative of the bridegroom (generally his sister) in
imitation of the Hindu custom, amidst the joyful shouts (kurava) of
women. Divorce is not effected by a civil tribunal. Marriages are
dissolved by the making good the amount mentioned in the kethuba or
marriage document. In regard to their funerals, the corpse is washed,
but not anointed, and is deposited in the burial-ground, which is
called Beth Haim, the house of the living.</p>
<p>Like their brethren in other parts of the world, the Cochin Jews
observe the Sabbath feasts and fasts blended intimately with their
religion, and practice the rite of circumcision on the eighth day, when
the child is also named. The Passover is celebrated by the distribution
of unleavened bread, but no kid is killed, nor is blood sprinkled upon
the door-post and lintel. The other feasts are the feast of Pentecost,
feast of Trumpets, and feast of Tabernacles. The day of atonement, and
the anniversary of the destruction of Jerusalem, are observed as fasts.
On the day of atonement, the Jews pray in the synagogue from 5
<span class="sc">A.M.</span> till 7 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> The
Jewish fasts commence from 5 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> on the day
previous to the fast, and end at 7 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> next
day. Their days begin and end with sunset. The feast of Tabernacles is
observed with more pomp and ceremony than other feasts. A pandal, or
temporary shed, with a flat roof, covered over with plaited leaves of
the cocoanut palm, and decorated with festoons, is put up in the
court-yard of, or near <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href=
"#pb491" name="pb491">491</a>]</span>every house, beneath which the
inmates of the house assemble and take their meals. On the last day of
the feast, a large can filled with oil is lit up in front of the
synagogue. On that day, the congregation assembles in the synagogue.
Persons of both sexes and of all ages meet in the house of prayer,
which is gorgeously decorated for the occasion. On this day, when the
books are taken outside the synagogue by the male congregation, the
females, who are seated in the gallery, come into the synagogue, and,
when the books are taken back, they return to their gallery.</p>
<p>The genuine Jews are, as indicated, known as M&rsquo;yukhasim (those
of lineage or aristocracy), while converts from the low castes are
called non-M&rsquo;yukhasim. According to the opinion of Jewish Rabbis,
Tabila, or the holy Rabbinical bath, removes the social disabilities of
the latter. Those who have had recourse to this bath are free to marry
genuine Jews, but respect for caste, or racial prejudice, has
invariably stood in the way of such marriages being contracted.</p>
<p>From a recent note (1907), I gather that &ldquo;the Jews, realising
that higher and more advanced education is needed, have bestirred
themselves, and are earnestly endeavouring to establish an institution
which will bring their education up to the lower secondary standard.
The proposed school will be open to both the White and Black Jews. In
order to place the school on a good financial basis, one of the leading
Jews, Mr. S. Koder, approached the Anglo-Jewish Association for aid,
and that Society has readily agreed to provide a sum of &pound;150 a
year for the upkeep of the school. Generous, however, as this offer is,
it is found that the amount is insufficient to cover the expenditure;
so the Jews are going to raise a public subscription amongst
themselves, and they also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href=
"#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span>intend to apply to the Cochin
Darbar for a grant under the Educational Code.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<p>I was present at the Convocation of the Madras University in 1903,
when the Chancellor conferred the degree of Bachelor of Arts on the
first Jew who had passed the examination.</p>
<p>According to the Cochin Census, 1901, there were 180 White, and 957
Black Jews.</p>

account given of them is as follows. They were originally R&#257;zus
from the Northern Circars, who, coming to the Chendragiri R&#257;ja for
employment, were set to watch members of the Kamm&#257;la caste who
served the R&#257;ja, in order to prevent idleness or fraud. After some
time, the Kamm&#257;lans finished an idol&rsquo;s car, and, being
inflated with pride, demanded to be allowed to sit in it before the
sw&#257;mi was himself placed there. For their arrogance they were
expelled, and the R&#257;zus, having by observation learnt something of
their craft, discharged their duties to the community. Under the Nabobs
they abandoned this walk of life, and took to saddlery, whence came
their name from j&#299;ni a saddle, and now they are merely
muchis.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=

<p>Mr. W. Francis informs us<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9882src" href=
"#xd21e9882" name="xd21e9882src">60</a> that &ldquo;in Bellary

<p>At Nandy&#257;l in the Kurnool district, I recently saw a
J&#299;nigar, who makes &ldquo;lacquer&rdquo; (gesso) fans, trays,
large circular table tops, etc., and paintings of Hindu deities and
mythological subjects. He made a number of panels used in the dado of
Lady Curzon&rsquo;s boudoir at the circuit house, Delhi. A medal was
awarded to him for his gesso ware at the Delhi Exhibition, but it was,
in colouring, inferior to that of the collection which was sent to the
Indo-Colonial Exhibition in 1886. The &ldquo;lacquer&rdquo; ware of
Kurnool has been said to be perhaps the finest Indian gesso work
produced anywhere. The work turned out at Mandasa in Ganjam is much
bolder, and suitable for decoration on a large scale. A similar method
of decoration was formerly largely used in Saracenic architectural
decoration of interiors in various countries. The patterns of the
Kurnool ware are floral, and in slight relief, and the colours are very
bright with much gilding. At Nossam, in Ganjam, leather dishmats are
painted with pictures of deities and floral designs. Native circular
playing-cards, and fans made of palmyra leaves or paper and cloth
&ldquo;lacquered&rdquo; and painted in brilliant colours, are also made
here.</p>
<p>In the Nellore district, the J&#299;niga-v&#257;ndlu make toys,
pictures, and models in paper and pith. At Trichinopoly, very elaborate
and accurate models of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href=

flowers, bullock coaches, etc., are made of the pith of s&#333;la
(<i>&AElig;schynomene aspera</i>), which is also used in the
construction of s&#333;la topis (sun-hats). The Madras Museum possesses

"xd21e9921src" href="#xd21e9921" name="xd21e9921src">61</a> as being
&ldquo;like the D&#257;saris, itinerant jugglers and beggars. They are
divided into those who sell beads, and those who keep pigs. They are
dexterous snake-charmers, and pretend to a profound knowledge of charms
and medicine. They are very filthy in their habits. They have no
restrictions regarding food, may eat in the house of any S&#363;dra,
and allow widows to live in concubinage, only exacting a small money
penalty, and prohibiting her from washing herself with
turmeric-water.&rdquo; In addition to begging and pig-breeding, the
J&#333;gis are employed in the cultivation of land, in the destruction
of pariah dogs, scavenging, robbery and dacoity. Some of the women,
called Killeky&#257;ta, are professional tattooers. The J&#333;gis
wander about the country, taking with them (sometimes on donkeys) the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495</a>]</span>materials for their rude huts. The packs of the

J&#333;gis encamp on the outskirts of villages, usually on a plain or
dry bed of a tank. Their huts or gudisays are made of palmyra leaves

</div>
<p>In the Tamil country, the J&#333;gis are called Dhoddiyan or
Tottiyan (<i>q.v.</i>), and those who are employed as scavengers are
known as Koravas or Oddans. The scavengers do not mix with the rest of
the community. Some J&#333;gis assert that they have to live by begging
in consequence of a curse brought on them by Parvati, concerning whose
breasts one of their ancestors made some indiscreet remarks. They
consider themselves superior to M&#257;las and M&#257;digas, but an
Oddan (navvy caste) will not eat in the house of a J&#333;gi. They are
said to eat crocodiles, field rats, and cats. There is a tradition that
a J&#333;gi bridegroom, before tying the bottu (marriage badge) on his
bride&rsquo;s neck, had to tie it by means of a string dyed with
turmeric round the neck of a female cat. People sometimes object to the
catching of cats by J&#333;gis for food, as the detachment of a single
hair from the body of a cat is considered a heinous offence. To
overcome the objection, the J&#333;gi says that he wants the animal for
a marriage ceremony. On one occasion, I saw a M&#257;diga carrying home
a bag full of kittens, which, he said, he was going to eat.</p>
<p>The J&#333;gi mendicants go about, clad in a dirty loin-cloth (often
red in colour) and a strip of cloth over the shoulders, with cobras,
pythons, or rat snakes in baskets, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496"
href="#pb496" name="pb496">496</a>]</span>and carrying a bag slung over
the shoulder. The contents of one of these bags, which was examined,
were fruits of <i>Mimusops hexandra</i> and flower-spikes of <i>Lippia
nodiflora</i> (used for medicine), a snake-charming reed instrument, a
piece of cuttle-fish shell, porcupine quills (sold to goldsmiths for
brushes), a cocoanut shell containing a powder, narrikombu (spurious
jackals&rsquo; horns) such as are also manufactured by
Kuruvik&#257;rans, and two pieces of wood supposed to be an antidote
for snake-poisoning. The women go about the streets, decorated with
bangles and necklaces of beads, sharks&rsquo; vertebr&aelig;, and cowry
shells, bawling out &ldquo;Subbamma, Lachchamma,&rdquo; etc., and will
not move on till alms are given to them. They carry a capacious gourd,
which serves as a convenient receptacle for stolen articles.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the J&#333;gis have exogamous septs or
intip&#275;ru, of which the following are examples:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Vagiti, court-yard.</li>
<li>Uluvala, horse-gram.</li>
<li>Jalli, tassels of palmyra leaves put round the necks of bulls.</li>
<li>Vavati (relationship).</li>
<li>Gundra, round.</li>
<li>Bindhollu, brass water-pot.</li>
<li>Cheruku, sugar-cane.</li>
<li>Chappadi, insipid.</li>
<li>Boda D&#257;siri, bald-headed mendicant.</li>
<li>Gudi, temple.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the Mysore census, 1901, Killeky&#257;ta, Helava, Jangaliga, and
P&#257;kan&#257;ti were returned as being J&#333;gis. A few individuals
returned g&#333;tras, such as Vrishabha, K&#257;verimatha, and
Khedrumakula. At the Madras census, Siddaru, and P&#257;mula (snake)
were returned as sub-castes. P&#257;mula is applied as a synonym for
J&#333;gi, inasmuch as snake-charming is one of their occupations.</p>
<p>The women of the caste are said to be depraved, and prostitution is
common. As a proof of chastity, the ordeal of drinking a potful of
cow-dung water or chilly-water has to be undergone. If a man, proved
guilty of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href="#pb497" name=
"pb497">497</a>]</span>adultery, pleads inability to pay the fine, he
has to walk a furlong with a mill-stone on his head.</p>
<p>At the betrothal ceremony, a small sum of money and a pig are given
to the bride&rsquo;s party. The pig is killed, and a feast held, with
much consumption of liquor. Some of the features of the marriage
ceremony are worthy of notice. The kankanams, or threads which are tied
by the maternal uncles to the wrists of the bride and bridegroom, are
made of human hair, and to them are attached leaves of <i>Alangium
lamarckii</i> and <i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>. When the bridegroom and
his party proceed to the bride&rsquo;s hut for the ceremony of tying
the bottu (marriage badge), they are stopped by a rope or bamboo
screen, which is held by the relations of the bride and others. After a
short struggle, money is paid to the men who hold the rope or screen,
and the ceremonial is proceeded with. The rope is called vallepu thadu
or relationship rope, and is made to imply legitimate connection. The
bottu, consisting of a string of black beads, is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck, the bride and bridegroom sometimes sitting on a
pestle and mortar. Rice is thrown over them, and they are carried on
the shoulders of their maternal uncles beneath the marriage pandal
(booth). As with the Odd&#275;s and Upparavas, there is a saying that a
J&#333;gi widow may mount the marriage dais (<i>i.e.</i>, remarry)
seven times.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she is put in a hut made by her brother
or husband, which is thatched with twigs of <i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>,
margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>), mango (<i>Mangifera Indica</i>),
and <i>Vitex Negundo</i>. On the last day of the pollution ceremony the
girl&rsquo;s clothes and the hut are burnt.</p>
<p>The dead are always buried. The corpse is carried to the
burial-place, wrapped up in a cloth. Before it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498" name=
"pb498">498</a>]</span>lowered into the grave, all present throw rice
over the eyes, and a man of a different sept to the deceased places
four annas in the mouth. Within the grave the head is turned on one
side, and a cavity scooped out, in which various articles of food are
placed. Though the body is not burnt, fire is carried to the grave by
the son. Among the Jalli-vallu, a chicken and small quantity of salt
are placed in the armpit of the corpse. On the karm&#257;ndhiram, or
day of the final death ceremonies, cooked rice, vegetables, fruit, and
arrack are offered to the deceased. A cloth is spread near the grave,
and the son, and other agnates, place food thereon, while naming, one
after the other, their deceased ancestors. The food is eaten by
J&#333;gis of septs other than the Jalli-vallu, who throw it into
water. If septs other than the Jalli were to do this, they would be
fined. Those assembled proceed to a tank or river, and make an effigy
in mud, by the side of which an earthen lamp is placed. After the
offering of cooked rice, etc., the lamp and effigy are thrown into the
water. A man who is celebrating his wife&rsquo;s death-rites then has
his waist-thread cut by another widower while bathing.</p>
<p>The J&#333;gis worship Peddav&#257;du, Malalamma, Gangamma,
Ayyav&#257;ru, Rudramma, and Madura V&#299;rudu.</p>
<p>Some women wear, in addition to the marriage bottu, a special bottu
in honour of one of their gods. This is placed before the god and worn
by the eldest female of a family, passing on at her death to the next
eldest.</p>
<p>As regards the criminal propensities of the J&#333;gis, Mr. Mullaly
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10015src" href=
"#xd21e10015" name="xd21e10015src">63</a> &ldquo;On an excursion being
agreed upon by members of a Joghi gang, others of the fraternity
encamped in the vicinity are consulted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb499" href="#pb499" name="pb499">499</a>]</span>In some isolated spot
a n&#299;m tree (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) is chosen as a meeting
place. Here the preliminaries are settled, and their god Perumal is
invoked. They set out in bands of from twelve to fifteen, armed with
stout bamboo sticks. Scantily clad, and with their heads muffled up,
they await the arrival of the carts passing their place of hiding. In
twos and threes they attack the carts, which are usually driven off the
road, and not unfrequently upset, and the travellers are made to give
all they possess. The property is then given to the headman of the gang
for safe-keeping, and he secretes it in the vicinity of his hut, and
sets about the disposal of it. Their receivers are to be found among
the &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; oil-mongers of 11 villages in the
vicinity of their encampments, while property not disposed of locally
is taken to Madras. Readmission to caste after conviction, when
imprisonment is involved, is an easy matter. A feed and drink at the
expense of the &lsquo;unfortunate,&rsquo; generally defrayed from the
share of property which is kept by his more fortunate kinsfolk, are all
that is necessary, except the ceremony common to other classes of
having the tongue slightly burnt by a piece of hot gold. This is always
performed by the Jangam (headman) of the gang. The boys of the class
are employed by their elders in stealing grain stored at kalams
(threshing-floors), and, as opportunity offers, by slitting grain bags
loaded in carts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>J&#333;gi.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Kudubi.</p>
<p><b>J&#333;gi Gurukkal.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> Y&#333;gi Gurukkal.</p>
<p><b>J&#333;gi Purusha.</b>&mdash;The Purushas or J&#333;gi Purushas
seem to have come into existence in recent times, and to be divided
into two distinct classes, one of which has crystallised into a caste,
while the other merely follows a cult practiced by several other
castes. Those in South <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href=
"#pb500" name="pb500">500</a>]</span>Canara, who speak Mar&#257;thi and
Tulu, say that they form a caste, which will not admit members of other
castes into its ranks. There is a head mutt (religious institution) at
Kadiri, with subordinate mutts at Halori and Bhuvarasu, all in South
Canara. The J&#333;gi Purushas are disciples of one or other of these
mutts. Their special deity is Bairava, but some regard
Gorakshan&#257;th as their god. They are initiated into the Bairava
cult by their priest. They may lead either a celibate or married life.
The celibates should have a hole bored in the middle of the ear, and
wear therein a ring of rhinoceros horn or china-clay. Those who wish to
lead a married life need not have a hole in the ear, but, at the time
of their initiation, a piece of clay is pressed over the spot where the
hole should be. All J&#333;gi Purushas who have become the disciples of
a guru (spiritual instructor) of their cult ought to have a brass,
copper, or silver pipe, called singan&#257;tha, tied on a thread round
the neck. Before taking their meals, they are expected to pray to
Bairava, and blow the pipe.</p>
<p>The J&#333;gi Purushas follow the Makkalakattu system of inheritance
(in the male line), and, for their marriage ceremonies, engage a
Kar&#257;di Br&#257;hman. The dead are buried in a sitting posture. The
bojja, or final death ceremony, is usually performed on the twelfth
day, and a Br&#257;hman priest officiates thereat. The ceremony
consists in offering food to the crows, making presents to
Br&#257;hmans, and undergoing purificatory rites for the removal of
death pollution. If the deceased has been initiated into the Bairava
cult, p&#363;ja (worship) must be done at the grave every alternate day
from the third day till the bojja day.</p>
<p>Some J&#333;gi Purushas are professional mendicants, while others
work as coolies, peons, etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href=

<p><b>J&#333;nagan.</b>&mdash;J&#333;nagan is given, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as the name applied to &ldquo;Musalman traders of
partly Hindu parentage. The word is from the Tamil S&#333;nagan, which
means Arabia, and is not strictly the name of any Musalman tribe, but
is a loose term applied by the Tamils to Musalmans of mixed
descent.&rdquo; In the Gazetteer of South Arcot, Mr. Francis says that
&ldquo;the term J&#333;nagan or S&#333;nagan, meaning a native of
S&#333;nagan or Arabia, is applied by Hindus to both Labbais and
Marakk&#257;yars, but it is usually held to have a contemptuous
flavour.&rdquo; According to another version, J&#333;nagan is applied
to sea-fishermen and boatmen, and the more prosperous traders are
called Marakk&#257;yars. In a note on the M&#257;ppillas of Malabar,
Mr. Padmanabha Menon writes that &ldquo;the Muhammadans generally go by
the name of J&#333;naga M&#257;ppillas. J&#333;naka is believed to
stand for Yavanaka, <i>i.e.</i>, Greek.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>J&#333;ti</b> (light).&mdash;An exogamous sept of B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>J&#333;tinagara.</b>&mdash;J&#333;tinagara (people of the city of
light) and J&#333;tipana are high sounding synonyms of the Canarese
oil-pressing G&#257;nigas, who express illuminant oils from seeds. In
like manner, the Tamil oil-pressing V&#257;niyans are known as
J&#333;tinagaratt&#257;r and Tiru-vilakku Nagaratt&#257;r (dwellers in
the city of holy lamps).</p>
<p><b>Juda M&#257;ppilla.</b>&mdash;A name by which the Cochin Jews are
known.</p>
